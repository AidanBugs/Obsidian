# What is Fitness?
- Fitness can overall be broken down into 4 main categories: Strength, Endurance, Aesthetics, and Skill. 
	- Strength refers to one’s maximum exertion, for example a person’s PR on bench press is determined by the strength of their “push” muscles (mainly chest, triceps, shoulders).
	- Endurance refers more to how long one is able to exert for, take running or high rep push ups / squats for example.
	- Aesthetics refers to how fit someone looks. Bodybuilding is the art of sculpting one’s body to look aesthetic. Aesthetics are completely subjective from person to person and it is important to understand that body aesthetics is an artform. More muscle != more aesthetics. It is all about proportions and deception.
	- Skill refers to one’s ability to coordinate their body to achieve certain goals. Examples can include doing the splits, being able to handstand, doing pull ups (or other calisthenics skills), even throwing / catching a ball. While strength / endurance will help one achieve certain skills, in most cases someone will need to train towards a specific skill in order to achieve it.
- When someone excels in any of these categories they are typically considered “fit”. In addition, many of these categories work in tandem with each other and training one of the categories will help train the others. However, if you want to excel in a certain category it is important to focus on that category and the others will act as supplements / aids for the category you are training.
- Examples:
	- If your goal is to do a handstand, then practice handstands against the wall to focus on that skill. In turn, this will also affect the strength and endurance of your shoulders. Training shoulder press will help strengthen your shoulders, but the most important part of your training is practicing handstand progressions.
	- If your goal is to do more push ups in a row, this could be a strength or an endurance goal depending on where you are at in fitness. For example, if you can only do 4 pushups, then you need to increase your strength. But if you can do 40 pushups and you want to do more, then you are training to increase your endurance. However for both of these scenarios, improving your aesthetics by decreasing excess body fat will help make the exercise easier and help you achieve your goal.
- Another important thing about fitness is the mental part of it all / mindset. Unless you are a professional in the fitness industry, do not beat yourself up for not being as strong as a strongman or looking like Mr. Olympia. Similarly, you should not think of yourself poorly if you skip a day or two of working out. It is important to remember that fitness is a path of SELF improvement and should not negatively impact your mental health.
# Fitness Goal Settings
It is important to ask yourself why you want to train your fitness and what you can do to achieve YOUR fitness goals. Maybe if you don’t like the way your body looks then your training would be more oriented around aesthetics. Maybe you really enjoy rock climbing so your training would involve more endurance and strength to help improve your rock climbing skills. Even things like learning to dance could involve a lot of skill work and some endurance as well. It is important to reflect on why you want to be more fit, what category (or categories) do your goals fall under, then decide how you can train to achieve your goals.
# Training to be more Fit
There are a few key concepts that will help you in your fitness journey regardless of what you are training for.
## Consistency
Consistency is the most important part of training for fitness. If you only train once a month and only eat healthy for one day a week then how can you expect to see improvement?

It is always better to just do the bare minimum then to just start skipping days. This could be something like for any day you feel like skipping, do one push up / squat, or just get changed into clothes to workout in. Usually you will end up doing a little more than the minimum, but even if you don’t do anything extra, be proud that you still did something that day.
## Nutrition
Another extremely important part about fitness is nutrition and eating healthy. If you aren’t eating enough protein then your body will have a harder time building muscle. There is alot to discuss about nutrition but for fitness the key points are to eat plenty of protein and eat according to your goals (eat more if you want to get bigger and eat less if you want to lose weight).

You can use this [calorie calculator](https://www.calculator.net/calorie-calculator.html) to determine how many calories you should eat. While tracking calories will help your fitness journey, it is still beneficial to be aware of how much you should be eating and adjust accordingly without necessarily counting calories.
## Rest days / Sleep
In fitness it is important to get enough sleep in order for your muscles to recover. Additionally if your body is sore / or you are sick, then it is important to let your body recover by taking a day off or doing a light exercise day. 
## Progressive Overload
The concept of progressive overload is that your workouts should get harder overtime. Meaning your workout today should be easier than a workout you would do 2 months from now. There are 4 main ways to progressively overload, increase weight, increase reps, decrease rest time, and skill progression.

Increasing weight is simplest to track, before you would do 100 lbs bench press 4 times but now you can do 120 lbs 4 times. This is an example of increasing your strength (this will also increase your muscle endurance).

Increasing reps is doing the same weight more times. Last week you did 20 push ups and now do 30 push ups. This will build your endurance (also increase strength).

Decreasing rest is also a form of progressive overload that boosts muscular endurance (and strength) by decreasing time in between sets. Let's say you would do 10 pullups 3 times (3 sets of 10 reps) and in between sets you would rest for 3 minutes.
