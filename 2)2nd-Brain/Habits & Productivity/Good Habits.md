# What is a Good Habit
- Something you should do every day that will help you increase or maintain either your mental and/or your physical health
# Examples
- [[Fitness]] / Exercising
	- Read linked section
- Sleep
	- Sleep recharges your body both physically and mentally. Getting good quality sleep is the best way to improve the following day.
- Eating Healthy / Proper Diet
	- Eating healthy not only improves your physical health but it can also improve your mental health by improving your self image. Can also be a good way of building discipline and practice making smart choices.
- Stretch
	- Goes into the fitness section slightly. Stretching is a good way to strengthen your body without too much wear and tear.
- Meditation
	- Meditation is both a way to sharped your focus as well as a way to rest your mind. Meditating can be useful for lots of different things, see [[Negative Emotions]].
- Strengthen Relationships
	- Reach out to those close to you, spend time with them and do things to show them you appreciate them.
- Making Your Bed
	- At first I was overly skeptical of the whole make your bed the first thing in the morning, however starting it changed my mind. The idea is that making your bed is not a super difficult task (unless a high lofted bed, in which case opting out of this habit is entirely reasonable) which is productive and doesnâ€™t take too much time. It lets you start your day on a productive step and boosts mental.
