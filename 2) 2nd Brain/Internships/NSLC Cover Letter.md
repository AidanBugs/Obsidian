To whom it may concern,

As a passionate educator, leader, and NSLC alumnus, I am thrilled to apply for the Cybersecurity Assistant Teaching Assistant role. My experiences as a Taekwondo instructor, Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) Computer Science and Data Science student, and Spartan Ambassador have equipped me with the skills to inspire high school students, foster inclusive environments, and lead dynamic academic sessions—aligning seamlessly with NSLC’s mission to cultivate tomorrow’s leaders.  

**Leadership Through Mentorship: Taekwondo Instruction**  
For over a year, I’ve taught Taekwondo to students aged 4 to 18, balancing authority and support to ensure safety while nurturing confidence. For example, I worked closely with neurodiverse learners, adapting classes with clear visual directions and partner work to create an equitable space. Witnessing a student on the autism spectrum grow from hesitant participation to leading warm-up exercises reinforced my belief in tailored mentorship. This role honed my ability to communicate clearly, manage high-energy groups, and turn challenges into teachable moments—skills I will leverage to engage NSLC students in hands-on learning.  

**Collaborative Leadership: Spartan Ambassador**  
As a Spartan Ambassador, I guide prospective CWRU students through campus tours and facilitate small-group discussions about academic life. This role demands adaptability; I once pivoted a session on the spot when my group of students wanted to go to different events that were occuring at the same time. I solved this challenge by first messaging my manager if I could swap students with another group to ensure everyone goes to the events they want. After we seperated to different groups and attended the events, I made sure to reconvene with the other group to ensure each student was back with their group. Showing my adaptability and collaboration skills which allowed me to lead a dynamic and inclusive session.

**Technical Experience & NSLC Alumni Insight**  
My technical background in cybersecurity, penetration testing, and data analysis allows me to demystify complex concepts for learners. Having attended NSLC’s Data Science bootcamp @ Georgia Tech in 2022, I understand the transformative impact of its curriculum. For instance, my team’s project on Airport business data ignited my passion for data science and associated fields, such as computer science which lead me to cybersecurity, which I now study full time at CWRU.  

**Why NSLC?**  
NSLC’s emphasis on innovation, collaboration, and leadership mirrors my own values. I am eager to contribute my unique blend of mentorship experience, technical knowledge, and alumni perspective to create an environment where students feel challenged, supported, and inspired.  

Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background aligns with NSLC’s goals. I can be reached at 614-254-4960 or aidan.bugayong@gmail.com.

Sincerely,  

Aidan Bugayong
