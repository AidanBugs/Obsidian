## Experiences / Examples
### Please describe your experience working with students in an educational or mentoring capacity. What age groups have you worked with, and what did you find most rewarding about the experience?

I have worked as a Taekwondo instructor for over a year, where I have taught a variety of age ranges as young as 4 and old as high schoolers. While teaching Taekwondo is not the same as teaching academics, they are similar in the sense that you need to have a strong understanding of what you are teaching and have an eye for those who need more help to get started in the right direction. For me, the two things I found most rewarding about teaching people are watching them grow with your advice and also the admiration your students give you. Oftentimes many students started Taekwondo and struggled with coordination. As such, we always work with these students to by breaking down techniques into smaller steps and always offer consistent encouragement. Overtime, they imrpoved not only their coordination and technique but also their confidence.

### The NSLC is a bustling and fast-paced environment. How do you adapt to new and potentially stressful situations? Please provide an example of a high-pressure scenario you've encountered in the past and how you managed it.

I adapt in potentially stressful situations by quickly analyzing my options and trying to make the most rational option mitigating all potential damages. During my time working as a Taekwondo instructor, there was one time where a kid peed himself right as class was ending. I quickly had my coworker finish up the last part of class as I pulled the kid aside to the side exit, sneaking around to the bathroom, to avoid them embarrassingly walking infront of their fellow students and the parents. Once they were in the bathroom, my coworker had just finished up class so students were coming back to the lobby. As those students left the Taekwondo room, I asked my coworker to grab the mop from the backroom and clean up any spots, to ensure the following class was all safe and ready to go. While they cleaned the floor, I ran over to the front desk to call up the kids parents to see if they were on the way and if they could bring a change of clothes. This experience reinforced my ability to delegate tasks and prioritize student well-being under pressure—skills, whichI would apply at NSLC when managing tight schedules or resolving conflicts among students. 

### This position involves balancing multiple roles. Can you share an experience where you had to balance being authoritative and supportive, ensuring students' safety while also creating a positive and fun atmosphere?

Being a Taekwondo instructor is the perfect example of needing to be multiple roles for the students. For example, during class I need to be an authorative figure to ensure students are correctly following the class structure without there being any distractions. However, I also need to watch students to critique their technique and support them in improving their performance.During a sparring session, two students began competing aggressively, ignoring safety rules. I paused the activity, reminded everyone of the importance of control and respect, and demonstrated proper techniques. I then assigned them as partners with calmer students, being sure to keep an eye on them. After class I had the students apologize to eachother and explained to them that they are here to practice and have fun and that requires them to maintain a positive environment for the class. This maintained discipline while keeping the atmosphere positive.

### Please provide an example of how you make the people around you feel a sense of inclusion, belonging, and equity on a daily basis.

As a Taekwondo instructor, I have worked with several students on the autism spectrum who had diverse communication and sensory needs. For example, one student often became overwhelmed during noisy group activities. To support them, I collaborated with their parents to understand their preferences and introduced small adjustments, such reducing my volume and rate of speaking and providing clear, step-by-step visual instructions for drills. I also paired them with a patient peer partner during sparring sessions to foster social connection without pressure. Additionally, I structured classes with predictable routines and always tailored my feedback to each student's individual needs. Over time, this student grew more confident and began participating actively, even joining our dojangs leadership program where they practiced leading warm-up exercises for the class. These adaptations not only supported their success but also deepened the entire class’s understanding of inclusivity, showing how small changes can create a welcoming space for everyone.

### What past experiences do you have that directly relate to the program's field? This could include specific projects, tasks, or achievements that showcase your expertise.

In terms of artificial intelligence (AI), I have had a wide variety of experiences, such as AI bootcamps, Large Language Models (LLM) projects, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) focused internships and projects. For starters during my internship last summer I was part of a small team in which we developed and deployed a fully functional RAG application from scratch which allowed users to summarize customer reviews for a large variety of products. Our application collected over 130k reviews over more than 70k products. This was a great experience because it allowed me to learn a lot about the field of AI and also working in team environments. The RAG application’s focus on simplifying complex data aligns with NSLC’s mission to make AI accessible to high school students. For example, I could design workshops where students use similar tools to analyze real-world datasets

## Leadership
### This position requires a strong ability to lead small group discussions and academic sessions for long hours. Please share an example of a time when you successfully led a group discussion or taught a session, and how you ensured active participation and engagement.

I have done a variety of group or leadership oriented clubs / camps such as Emerging leadership program, Spartan Ambassadors, and of course NSLC. All of which focus on collaborating effectively in a group environment. For me, I have applied the various communication skills that I have learned into my group projects in school. Specifically, I was the group leader for a class project where we built a RAG application for our college's courses. During a 4-hour coding session, one member disengaged due to frustration with their task. I paused the group, offered a short break, and later re-assigned them to a role aligning with their strengths. I also introduced ‘progress check-ins’ every 30 minutes to celebrate small wins, which kept morale high and ensured active participation. These check-ins not only increased engagement but also allowed for us to identify road blocks and identify which areas needed our whole groups intention.
