# Application Questions
## Experiences / Examples
### Please describe your experience working with students in an educational or mentoring capacity. What age groups have you worked with, and what did you find most rewarding about the experience?

I have worked as a Taekwondo instructor for over a year, where I have taught a variety of age ranges as young as 4 and old as high schoolers. While teaching Taekwondo is not the same as teaching academics, they are similar in the sense that you need to have a strong understanding of what you are teaching and have an eye for those who need more help to get started in the right direction. For me, the two things I found most rewarding about teaching people are watching them grow with your advice and also the admiration your students give you.
