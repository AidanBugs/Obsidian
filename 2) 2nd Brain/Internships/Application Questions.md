## Experiences / Examples
### Please describe your experience working with students in an educational or mentoring capacity. What age groups have you worked with, and what did you find most rewarding about the experience?

I have worked as a Taekwondo instructor for over a year, where I have taught a variety of age ranges as young as 4 and old as high schoolers. While teaching Taekwondo is not the same as teaching academics, they are similar in the sense that you need to have a strong understanding of what you are teaching and have an eye for those who need more help to get started in the right direction. For me, the two things I found most rewarding about teaching people are watching them grow with your advice and also the admiration your students give you. 

### The NSLC is a bustling and fast-paced environment. How do you adapt to new and potentially stressful situations? Please provide an example of a high-pressure scenario you've encountered in the past and how you managed it.

I adapt in potentially stressful situations by quickly analyzing my options and trying to make the most rational option mitigating all potential damages. During my time working as a Taekwondo instructor, there was one time where a kid peed himself right as class was ending. I quickly had my coworker finish up the last part of class as I pulled the kid aside to the side exit, sneaking around to the bathroom, to avoid them embarrassingly walking infront of their fellow students and the parents. Once they were in the bathroom, my coworker had just finished up class so students were coming back to the lobby. As those students left the Taekwondo room, I asked my coworker to grab the mop from the backroom and clean up any spots, to ensure the following class was all safe and ready to go. While they cleaned the floor, I ran over to the front desk to call up the kids parents to see if they were on the way and if they could bring a change of clothes. This shows how I managed these stressful situations by making quick rational decisions to mitigate any potential embarrassements while utilizing the help of collegues to make sure the situation was handled correctly and responsibly. 

### This position involves balancing multiple roles. Can you share an experience where you had to balance being authoritative and supportive, ensuring students' safety while also creating a positive and fun atmosphere?

Being a Taekwondo instructor is the perfect example of needing to be multiple roles for the students. For example, during class I need to be an authorative figure to ensure students are correctly following the class structure without there being any distractions. However, I also need to watch students to critique their technique and support them in improving their performance. During sparring, I need to not only encourage students to keep their energy up but also look around to make sure that everyone is following the rules and no one is getting hurt.

### Please provide an example of how you make the people around you feel a sense of inclusion, belonging, and equity on a daily basis.

### What past experiences do you have that directly relate to the program's field? This could include specific projects, tasks, or achievements that showcase your expertise.

In terms of artificial intelligence (AI), I have had a wide variety of experiences, such as AI bootcamps, Large Language Models (LLM) projects, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) focused internships and projects. For starters during my internship last summer I was part of a small team in which we developed and deployed a fully functional RAG application from scratch which allowed users to summarize customer reviews for a large variety of products. This was a great experience because it allowed me to learn a lot about the field of AI and also working in team environments.

## Leadership
### This position requires a strong ability to lead small group discussions and academic sessions for long hours. Please share an example of a time when you successfully led a group discussion or taught a session, and how you ensured active participation and engagement.

I have done a variety of group or leadership oriented clubs / camps such as Emerging leadership program, Spartan Ambassadors, and of course NSLC. All of which focus on collaborating effectively in a group environment. For me, I have applied the various communication skills that I have learned into my group projects in school. Specifically, I was the group leader for a class project where we built a RAG application for our college's courses. The first thing I did as the group leader was to split up our code into sub parts to allow for an easier division of tasks. The second thing I did was to ask group members which aspects they were most interested in and then we assigned tasks accordingly. When members were more hesitant to speak up about which part they wanted, I asked them what coding experiences do they have and then suggested tasks similar to their strengths. Throughout our coding sessions, I asked members how their assigned part was going and if they needed help to ensure that everyone was included and actively participating in the coding project.
