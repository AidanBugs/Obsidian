# Bulletpoint Journaling
IMO the book overcomplicated this section. The idea is to make journaling simple by making it quick, ie bulletpointing. The things the book recommend listing are:
1. What did you do today?
2. What should you have done today?
3. What do you want to do more of tomorrow?
Since this practice is fairly quick and to the point, it also suggested to add habit tracking along with this method. For me, my daily notes have been used mostly as a habit tracker while the journal section seemed daunting. As such, I have implemented the bullet points into my journal in hopes I will journal more.
