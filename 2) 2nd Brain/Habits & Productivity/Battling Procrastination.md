# Why do we Procrastinate
We often procrastinate for 2 reasons:
- There are easier / more fun things to do
- The task at hand is too hard / daunting
# How to be more Productive and Procrastinate less
## Parkinson's Law
We take as much time to complete a task as the time we are allotted. This means to fight procrastination we need to set our own deadlines and stick to them.
## Just Start / 3 2 1 Rule
Oftentimes the task is a lot easier than we make it out to be and all we need is a little push to get started. There's a bunch of different tricks to convince yourself to start working, the main two I will be talking about are 3 2 1 and the 5 minute rule. 3 2 1 rule is you count down from three (mentally or out loud) then immediately take action, not allowing yourself to make excuses. The 5 minute rule is to tell yourself you only need to work on a task for 5 minutes. 5 minutes isn’t that long and just because you did the 5 minutes doesn’t mean you have to stop. If you do stop then great job you worked for 5 minutes! The things I like about these rules is that they are easy and they're flexible.
## Deep Work [[Deep Work]]
Simply scheduling time in your day as deep work time will greatly help you stay productive. For me, mornings are usually best, where I work for about 1-2 hours, but other people don’t have that time and work shortly after they come home or right before bed. Personally I did the latter whenever I did not have time in the morning. But the general idea is stay consistent with whatever time you choose and try your best to make this non-negotiable time for yourself.
## Create Sub Goals / Chunk up Bigger Tasks
Breaking goals into smaller goals will do 2 main things:
1) help you organize what needs to get done to achieve the bigger goal 
2) help the bigger goal seem less daunting.
Let's say you have a paper to write, you could break it into collecting data / quotes, organizing evidence, creating theme / argument, outline paper, and then actually writing it. Splitting up the paper into smaller tasks lets you focus on individual subtasks without making you feel forced to write the entire paper in one go.
