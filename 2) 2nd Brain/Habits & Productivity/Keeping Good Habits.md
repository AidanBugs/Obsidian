# Summary (TLDR)
- Make the habit as easy and convenient as possible, START SMALL
- Don’t start by overworking yourself, ease into new habits slowly and gradually
- Use deadlines and make specific goals, easier for you to comprehend and focus
# Convenience
- Focus on making the habit super convenient and readily accessible
- For example, goal is to start a reading habit then try doing the following:
	- Book in plain sight and easy to access, do not leave in bookshelf
		- This acts as a reminder and makes it easy to access
	- Have a light / book mark ready before you even need to read
		- This makes it so you don’t have the excuse of “i need to grab this”
- Another example for running (i think from David Goggins)
	- Go to bed with your running clothes for the next day and have running shoes close by
		- Less excuse of “I need to get ready blah blah blah” you are already ready
- Breaking bad habits is just a matter of making those habits less convenient to do
- If your goal is to stop eating unhealthy snacks you can do the following:
	- Stop buying snacks
	- Put snacks on the top shelf and out of sight
		- Hard to get (less convenient) hard to see (less reminders)
# Make the Habit Easy
- Focus on just the start / setup
	- Your brain won’t feel the daunting pressure of doing the actual task if you think of just setting up, examples:
		- Goal to study: get out your textbook and computer for notes
		- Goal to go on run: just get dressed and put shoes on
- Concept of “Just One”
	- Makes the goal seem more feasible, examples:
		- One pushup a day
		- One page of reading
- Two 2 minute rules (Cajun Koi)
	- If the thing you want to do takes 2 minutes, do it right away
		- Prevents you from forgetting about it
		- Prevents things from piling up
	- Focus on just starting the first 2 minutes
		- Goal to study? Just study for 2 minutes
		- Read for 2 minutes
- Notes for the above rules:
	- Just because the goal is just 1 or 2 does not mean only do 1 or 2 reps or whatever. It means that is the minimum you must do. This is just to start the habit and avoid making any excuses for not doing the habit. Once you take a few rest days is when you will start to make excuses and stop doing the habit. Also take note of the concept below.
# Avoid Burnout
- Do not try and maintain absurd numbers ei: 1000 pushups a day
	- Start small and build your way up to higher numbers
		- This is a SLOW process, the end goal is a sustainable habit so DO NOT increase numbers too quickly 
- Stick to 1 or 2 new habits at a time
	- If you try focusing your energy to too many NEW habits you will burn yourself out quickly

	- Once you have fully integrated habits into your daily routine then you can start to add new ones
- DO NOT FOCUS ON STREAK
	- In my opinion a bad part of habit tracking apps is the streak feature
		- This may be interesting at first and cause you to try and reach high streaks but once the streak ends you lose motivation to get back up to those high streaks
	- Look at goals/habits holistically or percentage wise
		- You exercised 5/7 times this week looks a lot better than you had a 2 day streak and a 3 day streak this week. 
- Burnout is okay AFTER you have fully integrated those habits
	- Helps you find your limit and then try to maximize yourself just below your limit so you won’t burnout. Eventually you may find yourself at this “limit” and find that it is no longer your limit.
# Know how to set and Stick to Deadlines
- We have all been there, assignments due at 11:59 and so we start at 11 and it is an intense rush to turn this in on time. We naturally tend to focus more when we have a perceived deadline so use deadlines to your advantage! This can help with all aspects of building good habits. 
- Many highschoolers tend to wake up early enough to meet the “deadline” of going to school / practice on time. Then on the weekends when they don’t have this deadline, they will sleep in. 
- Keeping the above in mind you should do the following:
- Avoid weekly goals
	- You will start to take break days and let the work pile up until the end of the week. Then you will work really hard to keep the goal then just end up burning yourself out and giving up on the habit.
	- An exception to this is if you set deadlines throughout the week in order to achieve the weekly goal
- Daily goals / timely goals, ex: every day before 7:30 I will do 10 pushups
	- Gives a deadline and a need to get up early and get things done
- Chunk things up
	- If the goal is to write an essay by the end of the week, do not wait until the end of the week, instead think of working on the essay a little bit everyday. Then when it comes to the end of week deadline, you will either already have a completed essay or not much more to write.
