# What is Existentialism?
Despite the world lacking inherent meaning, we are responsible for giving ourselves meaning. We are responsible for defining our meaning and pursuing it. One's purpose is their essence, their reason for being. Jean Paul Sartre gave the example of a paper-knife, whose essence is to cut paper. The essence of the paper-knife was conceived before it came into existence. For the paper-knife, its essence precedes its existence. However for humans, existence precedes essence, meaning humans first exist then discover their purpose.
## Sartre
Freedom for Sartre is the autonomy of choices, or the ability to make choices. We alone are responsible for the actions we make and the situation we are in. We are condemned to be free, meaning we are free and thus responsible for ourselves and he views this as a heavy burden. We alone are responsible for our actions and aligning our actions with our essence, our purpose.

Sartre believes those who use their situation or others as an excuse for their actions are committing bad faith. Bad faith is not being true to oneself by giving up their freedom and ability to choose and going against one's purpose.
