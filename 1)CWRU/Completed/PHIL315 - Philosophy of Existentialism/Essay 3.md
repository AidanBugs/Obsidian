Existentialism, with its roots in the Western philosophical tradition, often emphasizes individualism and the autonomy of self. This contrasts sharply with Eastern perspectives, particularly Japanese philosophical and cultural paradigms, which frequently prioritize group harmony and interconnectedness. This essay will explore the tensions and overlaps between these perspectives, focusing on Japanese cultural concepts such as Shudan Ishiki, Ikigai, and insights from Keiji Nishitani's work in relation to Jean-Paul Sartre's Being and Nothingness and Simone de Beauvoir's writings, such as America Day by Day.  

The Japanese Mind: Understanding Contemporary Japanese Culture written by Roger Davies is a short summary of a wide variety of terms and concepts referring to Japanese culture. For starters, Shudan Ishiki, or "group consciousness," reflects a Japanese idea that the collective takes precedence over individual desires. Roger Davies notes that “In Japanese Society, people are primarily group-orientated and give more priority to group harmony than to individuals” (The Japanese Mind: Understanding Contemporary Japanese Culture, p. 195). In Japanese society, individuals are expected to align their actions with group norms to maintain unity. This directly contrasts with Sartre's existentialist notion of radical freedom and the "for-itself" consciousness, where an individual continually defines themselves through choices, unconstrained by external norms. Sartre argues that we are "condemned to be free" (Being and Nothingness, p. 129) and must bear full responsibility for his actions, a notion that might be alien in the Shudan Ishiki framework​. In fact, Davis explicitly states that "what benefits the group is mostly is mostly regarded as the correct thing to do" (The Japanese Mind: Understanding Contemporary Japanese Culture, p. 197). This almost entirely goes against Sartre's idea of being able to define oneself through their actions regardless of societal pressure or one's situation. The interplay between these perspectives raises questions about authenticity and alienation. Sartre’s claim that individuals experience alienation when they adhere to external prescriptions contrasts with the Japanese view, which sees fulfilling group expectations as integral to social belonging.

In fact, Charles Moore wrote in The Japanese Mind: Essentials of Japanese Philosophy and Culture about the role of an individual in Japanese society. Moore explains that since "the Japanese has deemed strong self-assertion ugly, [one] seldom expresses his opinion in the presence of others" (p. 256). Moore thus further amplify the idea that Japanese suppress their thoughts in order to preserve group harmony. This strongly goes against the strong sense of individualism present in Sartre's existentialism and western culture. However, this is similar to another concept in The Japanese Mind: Understanding Contemporary Japanese Culture, where Davies explains another Japanese concept called "Honne to Tatemae". According to Davies, "honne is one's deep motive or intention, while tatemae refers to motives or intentions that are socially-tuned" (p. 115). 

Another important concept in Japanese society is "Ikigai". According to the Oxford  Dictionary, ikigai refers to "a motivating force; something or someone that gives a person a sense of purpose or a reason for living" (Oxford Dictionary). This concept is quite similar to one's essence defined in Sartre's philosophy, Sartre in Existentialism is a Humanism, gives the example of a paper knife, whose essence is to cut paper. In this case the essence of the paper knife precedes its existence because its craftsman had its purpose in mind upon crafting the paper knife. However, Sartre claims for humans existence precedes essence because "Man first of all exists, encounters himself, surges up in the world, and defines himself afterwards" (Existentialism is a Humanism, p. 5). In Sartre's philosophy, one's purpose is their essence, it is their very reason for being. The Japanese concept of Ikigai, meaning “a reason for being,” offers an interesting parallel to existentialist themes.  However, Ikigai diverges in its communal focus, blending personal fulfillment with societal contribution. In contrast, existentialism as articulated by Sartre often frames purpose in terms of individualistic pursuits, detached from collective concerns. This divergence underlines the cultural differences in conceptualizing purpose and identity.

In general, western cultures tend to focus on autonomy and the self as opposed to Japan which focuses on group harmony and obligation. The Japanese Mind: Understanding Contemporary Japanese Culture also talks about a concept called "Bushido" which refers to the "way of the warrior" (p. 41). Bushido consists mainly of two pillars, honor and loyalty. For example, Japanese warriors (samurai) were so loyal to their nation and their code that they possessed the "will to die" (p. 45). There are two examples of this in Japanese culture: kamikaze, and seppuku. In the case of kamikaze, this is when a warrior chooses to die / injure themselves and take out many enemies in the process, such as pilots who crashed their planes into enemy troops. This is because samurai believe so strongly in their sense of duty that they believe it is better to "Die rather than disgrace yourself" (p. 46). If one disgraced themselves in battle, oftentimes their way of atoning for their mistakes is to commit seppuku. According to Davies, "seppuku, or suicide by self disembowelment, was the most honorable death for a samurai. The abdomen was regarded as the place where the soul and affections dwelled, so the samurai showed their integrity in this way" (The Japanese Mind: Understanding Contemporary Japanese Culture, p. 46). In Japanese culture, the group purpose and harmony is what gave these methods of suicide purpose. It is important to note that bushido is the way of the warrior, meaning this strict code is meant to apply to samurai and not necessarily the average Japanese citizen. That being said, the fact that samurais have the resolve to kill themselves to maintain their honor and serve toward their group's purpose shows how dedicated samurais are to maintaining group harmony. However, in America Day by Day, Simone De Beauvoir meets someone who is almost the exact opposite. In New York, De Beauvoir meets a "light-skinned black man" who "never goes out without a revolver in his pocket" (p. 336). The reason this man does this is because "the idea that a white man might insult him is so unbearable that he has decided that if it ever happens, he will kill the offending party and then himself" (p. 336). While this is an extreme case, the fact that this man lives entirely by his own rules and honor is similar yet the complete opposite of the samurai of Japan. Samurai kill themself to maintain their honor and the honor of their family, for if they bring back shame from a battlefield it is shame for their whole family. Yet this western man is willing to kill and be killed entirely for his own values and honor, not for the honor of someone else or because he feels he is obligated to do so. This kind of extreme autonomy is not present in Japanese culture as the only reason one would go to such extreme measures is for the sake of the group. If we go back to the idea of essence being one's purpose and is defined through one's actions, then the American man's purpose is entirely his own, giving him a strong sense of individualism, whereas the essences of Japanese warriors are strongly tied to group harmony, in the sense they wish to preserve the honor of their family and serve the purpose of their group, which they see as more important than themselves. 

In fact, Keiji Nishitani, a Japanese philosopher, writes about the problems with complete autonomy in his book Religion and Nothingness. Nishitani describes the relationship between people and things as master and servant, similar to subject and object in Being and Nothingness. Nishitani asks "if we grant that each and every thing, in its mode of being as what it is in itself, enjoys an absolute autonomy and occupies the rank of master seated at the center of everything, how are we to avoid thinking of such a situation as complete anarchy and utter chaos?" (Religion and Nothingness, pg. 147). Essentially, Nishitani recognizes the chaos caused by the strongly interconnected web of master and servant where each relationship is dependent on which perspective one chooses. This is similar to how Sartre believes that we are the subject of our own eyes and things around us are objects. However, Sartre focuses more on the relation of objects to the subject, that is, focusing on how one perceives those around it, whereas Nishitani recognizes the importance of the subject as an object to other subjects. Nishitani states "not a single thing comes into being without some relationship to every other thing" (Religion and Nothingness, p 149), emphasizing the importance of one's servant relation to its own servants. Using these relationships and other passages from Religion and Nothingness, Gerald Nelson Jr. constructed an ethics system for sympathy. In Nelson's work A Nishitanian Ethics of Sympathy, Nelson expanded on the interconnected relationships of others and stated that his "being is essentially co-constitutive of the beings of all others such that [he] support[s] and constitute[s] all other beings, and reciprocally all other beings support and constitute [his] existence" (p. 3). Essentially, Nelson states that one's being is partially comprised of the beings of those whom one supports. While the interconnectedness of objects and subjects exist in Sartre's existentialism, the idea that one's being is constructed of the beings of others. Rather Sartre believes in a much more individualistic approach where one is entirely responsible for their own purpose and existence. 

  

  

De Beauvoir’s reflections in The Second Sex also shed light on the intersection of self and society. She critiques existentialism's tendency to universalize experiences that are, in reality, deeply gendered and context-specific ​(The Second Sex). Her insights resonate with the Buddhist critique of the ego, underscoring the illusory nature of absolute autonomy.

Danjyo Kankei and Gendered Existentialism

In Japanese society, Danjyo Kankei—gender relations—are informed by cultural expectations that often subordinate individual aspirations to prescribed roles. As explored in The Japanese Mind, these relationships reflect a societal structure that contrasts sharply with Beauvoir’s existentialist feminism, which calls for women to transcend the roles imposed on them by a patriarchal society​(The Japanese Mind_ Esse…)​(The Japanese Mind -- Ro…). De Beauvoir asserts, “One is not born, but rather becomes, a woman,” emphasizing the fluidity and constructed nature of identity​(The Second Sex -- Simon…).

This cultural dichotomy highlights the limitations of existentialist theories when applied universally, especially in contexts like Japan, where group-oriented and relational philosophies dominate.

Conclusion

  Ultimately, De Beauvoir’s journey through postwar America captures her grappling with cultural alienation and the existentialist tension between freedom and societal constraints. In contrast, Japanese philosophical traditions, deeply influenced by Zen Buddhism and collective social ethics, offer an alternative approach to these same questions. By placing these Sartrean existentialism side by side with Japanese philosophy, we see how culture shapes our responses to universal existential dilemmas. The existentialist emphasis on self-determination and individual freedom finds limited resonance in the Japanese philosophical and cultural landscape, where collective harmony and relational identity are central. Yet, concepts like Ikigai and insights from Nishitani demonstrate potential bridges between these paradigms. The tensions and dialogues between Eastern and Western perspectives on existentialism invite us to reconsider the universality of philosophical doctrines and appreciate the diverse ways in which humanity grapples with the question of existence.
