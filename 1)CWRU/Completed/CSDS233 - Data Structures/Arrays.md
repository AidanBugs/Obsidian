# Array
Arrays are a set size and are considered static data structures.
``` python
Array = ["A", "B", "C"]
```
Most languages are 0 based indexing, meaning the first element in the array is assigned the index 0.

As such, to find the first element in our example array $Array$, we would call it by using $Array[0]$. This would return $A$.

We can use functions such as $pop$ and $append$ to remove / add elements. $pop$ removes the first element and $append$ adds a new element to the end of the list.

Because an array is a static structure, finding its length is constant time.
