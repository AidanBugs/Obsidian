# Data as Objects and Attributes
A data object is one data point in a data set. An attribute is one component of a data object. For example, given a data set (group of data objects) of humans, the attributes of a data object could be eye color, hair color, height, etc. Whereas a data object would just be one human with their given attributes.
## Attributes vs. Attribute Values
An attribute could have different attribute values. Example: Height (attribute) could be measured in feet or meters (attribute values).
## Types of Attributes
### Nominal (Categorical)
Examples: eye color, zip code
### Ordinal (Attribute can be ordered)
Examples: Rankings, grades, height
### Interval (Distance is meaningful)
Examples: Calendar dates
### Ratio: Absolute Zero - (Meaningful Fraction / Ratio)
Examples: Temperature in kelvin, length, time, counts
