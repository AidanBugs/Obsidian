## Topics (Probably)
### Alternate TMs
For these problems u just gotta figure out how to cook

Example problems:

- Broken Left TM
- Left delete TM

### Undecidable Languages
For these prove $A_{TM}$ is decidable with a machine that decides the language (proof by contradiction)

Example problems:

- A language that recognizes machines of a language
- A language $L$ where $A_{TM}$ is many-to-one reducible to $L$
- $\bar{A_{TM}}$ is undecidable

### Many to one reducible
For these prove there exists a function $f$ such that $x\in A_{TM}\leftrightarrow f(x)\in L$
