In order to prove this, we can prove there exists a function $f$ such that $x\in A_{TM}\leftrightarrow f(x)\in L_{343}$

Remember $x=<M,w>$ and $f(x)=<M'>$

$M'$ on input $y$:

- Run $M$ on $w$
- If $M$ accepts:
    - Check if $y$ is equal to "CSDS 343 is fun"
    - If yes -> Accept
    - Else
        - Check if $y$ is equal to "MATH 343 is fun"
        - If yes -> Accept
        - Else -> Reject
- If $M$ rejects:
    - $M'$ rejects

If $x\in A_{TM}$ show $f(x)\in L_{343}$

- If $f(x)\in L_{343}$ then $M'$ must accept $y$ if it is "CSDS 343 is fun" or "MATH 343 is fun", otherwise reject.
- In the case $y$ is "CSDS 343 is fun" or $MATH 343 is fun"
    - $M'$ runs $M$ on $w$ which accepts because $x\in A_{TM}$. Next $M'$ checks if $y$ is "CSDS 343 is fun" if it is $M'$ accepts. Then checks if $y$ is "MATH 343 is fun" if it is $M'$ accepts. Thus $M'$ accepts when it should when $x\in A_{TM}$
- In the case $y$ is not $CSDS 343 is fun" or "MATH 343 is fun"
    - $M'$ runs $M$ on $w$ which accepts because $x\in A_{TM}$. Next $M'$ checks if $y$ is "CSDS 343 is fun", then checks if $y$ is "MATH 343 is fun". Since $y$ is neither "CSDS 343 is fun" or "MATH 343 is fun" $M'$ will reject. Thus $M'$ rejects when it should when $x\in A_{TM}$

If $x\notin A_{TM}$ Show $f(x)\notin L_{343}$

- Since $x\notin A_{TM}$, $M'$ will run $M$ on $w$ which rejects so $M'$ will reject. Thus, even if $y=$ "CSDS 343 is fun" $M'$ will reject so $<M'>\notin L_{343}$

Thus because $\exists f$ s.t. $x\in A_{TM}\leftrightarrow f(x)\in L_{343}$ then $A_{TM}\leq_{m} L_343$. Thus since we know $A_{TM}$ is reducible to $L_{343}$ and $A_{TM}$ is unddecidable, then $L_{343}$ is undecidable.

Proof by contradiction. So assume $DIFF\_ BY\_ 1$ is decidable. Then $\exists M_{DIFF}$ which decides $DIFF\_ BY\_ 1$

Create a TM $M$ which takes a TM $<m>$ as input

$M$ on input $<m>$

- Run $M_{DIFF}$ on $<M,m>$
- If $M_{DIFF}$ accepts, $M$ rejects
- If $M_{DIFF}$ rejects, $M$ accepts

Create a TM $M'$ which takes $y$ as input

$M'$ on input $y$

- If $y=M'$ reject
- Else run $M$ on $y$
    - If $M$ accepts, $M'$ accepts
    - If $M$ rejects, $M'$ rejects

Now suppose we run $M$ on $M'$, which will then run $M_{DIFF}$ on $<M,M'>$

If $M_{DIFF}$ accepts $<M,M'>$, then $M$ will reject on $M'$. However this creates a contradiction because $M_{DIFF}$ says $<M,M'>$ are different by 1, however $M$ and $M'$ both accept / reject on the same input (they are not different by 1) because $M'$ runs $M$ and rejects on input $M'$. Thus they are not different by 1 and $M_{DIFF}$ should reject.

If $M_{DIFF}$ rejects $<M,M'>$, then $M$ will accept on $M'$. However this creates a contradiction because $M_{DIFF}$ says $<M,M'>$ are not different by 1, however $M$ and $M'$ both accept / reject on the same input except for input $M'$ where $M'$ rejects and $M$ accepts. Thus they are different by one and $M_{DIFF}$ should accept.

### A Prove $A_{TM}\leq_{M}L_{add}$
In order to prove this, we must prove there exists a function $f$ such that $x\in A_{TM}\leftrightarrow f(x)\in L_{add}$

Remember $x=<M,w>$ and $f(x)=<M'>$

$M'$ on input $y$:

- Run $M$ on $w$
- If $M$ accepts:
    - Run a M in Ladd
- If $M$ rejects:
    - $M'$ rejects

### B Prove $\bar{A_{TM}}\leq_{M}L_{add}$
In order to prove this, we must prove there exists a function $f$ such that $x\in \bar{A_{TM}}\leftrightarrow f(x)\in L_{add}$

Remember $x=<M,w>$ and $f(x)=<M'>$

$M'$ on input $y$:

- Run $M$ on $w$
- If $M$ rejects:
    - Run $M_{add}$ on $y$   // $M_{add}\in L_{add}$
- If $M$ accepts:
    - $M'$ rejects
