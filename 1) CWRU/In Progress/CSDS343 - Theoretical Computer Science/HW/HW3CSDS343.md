Let's try to relate out multi-core turing machine to a k-tape turing machine. Our k-tape turing maachine has a theorem which any language $L$ can be decided on a k-tape turing machine can also be decided on a normal turing machine.

Unlike the multi-core turing machine, our k-tape turing machine only processes one state at a time as opposed to one state for each head.
