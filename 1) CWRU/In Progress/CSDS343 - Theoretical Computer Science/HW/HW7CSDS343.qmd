## A
Prove if $L_1 \in P$ then $\bar{L_1}\in P$

> ### Proof
>
> If $L_1\in P$ then $\exists k$ s.t. $L\in TIME(n^k)$, that is, $L_1$ is decided by a deterministic machine in polynomial time. 
>
> Since $L_1\in TIME(n^k)$, then the max of $t_m(n)$ of $x\in L_1$ and $t_m(n)$ of $x\notin L_1$ is $n^k$. This means a TM $M$ decides $L_1$ in polynomial time.
>
> We can create a 3 tape machine $M'$ that flips the output of $M$ on $x$ by running $M$ on tape 2 and keeping track of the state on tape 3. Once $M$ finishes $M'$ accepts if 
>
> As discussed, running $M$ will be $O(n^k)$ time. Reading the final state of $M$ would be $O(n)$ time (where $n$ is length of tape 3). So final runtime is $O(n^k)$, thus $M'\in t_m(n^k)$.
>
> We know $M'$ decides $\bar{L_1}$ because for $x\in \bar{L_1}$, $M$ rejects so $M'$ accepts and for $x\notin \bar{L_1}$, $M$ accepts so $M'$ rejects.
>
> Thus since $M'$ decides $\bar{L_1}$ and $M'\in t_m(n^k)$ then $\bar{L_1}\in TIME(n^k)$ so $\bar{L_1}\in P$

## B
Explain why the techinque you used in part a fails to prove $L_1\in NP \rightarrow \bar{L_1}\in NP$

> The proof would need to prove there exists a verifier for $\bar{L_1}$ which is not present in part A. The techinque used in part A determined the runtime of our machine whereas this proof for $NP$ would need to show there is a verifier $V\in P$ for $\bar{L_1}$

## C
Prove $(L_1\in P \land L_2\in P)\rightarrow L_1\circ L_2 \in P$

> ### Idea
>
> If $L_1\in P \land L_2\in P$ then $\exists M_1,M_2$ that run in polynomial time that decide $L_1,L_2$.
>
> Lets create a TM $M_3$ to decide $L_1\circ L_2$ and prove that it decides the concatenation in polynomial time.
>
> $M_3$ will be a 4 tape machine. Tape 1 contains the input string. Tape 2 is working space for $M_1/M_2$ and Tape 3 will contain the state of the current working machine. Tape 4 contains the length of the working substring (by storing the length as a number of 0's).
>
> $M_3$ will count the number of 0's o tape 4 and copy that many characters from the start of Tape 1 onto Tape 2. We then simulate $M_1$ on this string, storing the state on Tape 3. If $M_1$ accepts, then we clear Tapes 2 and 3 then count the number of 0's on Tape 4 and skip that many characters on Tape 1 then copy remaining string to Tape 2. Then simulate $M_2$ on Tape 2 and store the state on Tape 3. If $M_2$ accepts then $M_3$ will accept. Otherwiseif $M_1$ or $M_2$ reject then we add a 0 to Tape 4 and repeat the above steps. If at any point the number of 0's exceed the length of the input string then $M_3$ rejects.  
>
> ### Proof $M_3$ decides $L_1\circ L_2$
>
> If $w\in L_1\circ L_2$ then $\exists x,y | w=xy \land x\in L_1 \land y\in L_2$.
>
> > $M_3$ iterates through $w$ running $M_1$ on every possible $x$ in $w$. If $M_1$ accepts $x$, then $M_3$ runs $M_2$ on the remaining string ($y$) and will accept if $M_2$ accepts. Since we know there is an $x,y$ pair that are in their respective languages, we know $M_3$ will accept on this pair because it tests every possible $x,y$ combination.
>
> If $w\notin L_1\circ L_2$ then $\nexists x,y | w=xy \land x\in L_1 \land y\in L_2$.
>
> > $M_3$ iterates through $w$ running $M_1$ on every possible $x$ in $w$. Since there is no $x,y$ pair that satisfy the concatenation, $M_1$ or $M_2$ will reject on $x,y$ for each iteration. Eventually once we have exhausted each $x,y$ pair, $M_3$ will reject once the number of 0's exceed the length of the input, that is $M_3$ rejects if we try to copy an $x$ where $|x|>|w|$. Thus, $M_3$ rejects if $w\notin L_1\circ L_2$.
>
> Therefore $M_3$ decides $L_1\circ L_2$.
>
> ### Proof $t_{M_3}(n)\in O(n^{k+1})$
>
> For both $w\in L_1\circ L_2\land w\notin L_1\circ L_2$, $M_3$ makes (at most) the following steps at each iteration:
>
> - Copy $x$ onto Tape 2 -> $O(n)$
> - Run $M_1$ on $x$ -> $O(n^k)$
> - Read $M_1$ final state -> $O(1)$
> - Clear Tape 2 and 3 -> $O(n)$
> - Copy $y$ onto Tape 2 -> $O(n)$
> - Run $M_2$ on $y$ -> $O(n^k)$
> - Read $M_2$ final state -> $O(1)$
> - Add another 0 to tape $4$ -> $O(n)$
>
> As we can see each of these steps are polynomial time and we can find the runtime of a single iteration as $O(n+n^k+1+n+n+n^k+1+n)=O(n^k)$. We do at most $n+1$ iterations of this so $t_{M_3}(n)=O((n+1)n^k)=O(n^k+1)$ which is polynomial time. 
>
> Therefore $L_1\circ L_2\in P$ because we created a machine that decides the language in polynomial time.

Prove MAJORITY-SAT is NP-complete

> ### Prove $MAJORITY-SAT\in NP$
>
> Our guess would simply be the assignments of the variables (ie true or false).
>
> ### Prove $3-SAT \leq_p MAJORITY-SAT$
>
> We can map each clause in $3-SAT$ which consists of literals $a,b,c$ to a new clause in MAJORITY-SAT which consists of literals $a,b,c,x,y$, where $x,y$ are new literals not in our $3-SAT$ problem. 
>
> Since $x,y$ are new literals, they can be $T/F$ unlike $a,b,c$ which are $T$ iff they are $T$ in $3-SAT$.
>
> ### Proof:
>
> If $F\in 3-SAT$ then $f(F)\in MAJORITY-SAT$
>
> > If $F\in 3-SAT$ then $\exists$ assignments where each clause is true.
>
> > This means for all clauses in $F$, at least one literal is true.
>
> > Then our CNF for $MAJORITY-SAT$ ($f(F)$) has at least one literal from all clauses in $F$ true.
>
> > This means $f(F)\in MAJORITY-SAT$ because all clauses in $F$ have at least one true literal, so each clause in $MAJORITY-SAT$ have at least one true literal besides $x,y$. If $x,y$ are true then that clause will have majority true because we have one true literal from $F$ and $x,y$ are true.
>
> > Therefore, if $F\in 3-SAT$ then $f(F)\in MAJORITY-SAT$
>
> If $F\notin 3-SAT$ then $f(F)\notin MAJORITY-SAT$
>
> > If $F\notin 3-SAT$ then there exists at least one clause in $F$ that is false. That means this clause has all false for the literals.
>
> > For $f(F)$ that means that this clause will have 3 false literals from $F$ and $x,y$ which can be true or false. Even if both $x,y$ are true, we will not have a majority true for this clause. Meaning $f(F)\notin MAJORITY-SAT$
>
> > Therefore if $F\notin 3-SAT$ then $f(F)\notin MAJORITY-SAT$
>
> If $f(F)\in MAJORITY-SAT$ then $F\in 3-SAT$
>
> If $f(F)\notin MAJORITY-SAT$ then $F\notin 3-SAT$
>
> As such, our clause in $3-SAT$ is true iff our clause in $MAJORITY-SAT$ is true. So $3-SAT\leq_p MAJORITY-SAT$.

Prove the 0-1 integer programming problem is NP-complete

> ### Prove $SAT\leq_p INT$
>
> For our function, each literal in $SAT$ matches to one $x$ variable in $INT$ and each clause in $SAT$ matches to one linear inequality in $INT$.
>
> Our function $f$ makes a set of linear equations mapping each variable in $F$ to the variabls in our system of linear inequalities. Then all $b_1...b_m$ are equal to $-1$. For coeffecients, $a_{i,j}=-1$ if $l_j$ is a literal in the $i$th clause, and $a_{i,j}=0$ otherwise. For each negation of a literal $l_j$ in a clause ($i$), we increase $b_i$ by $1$ and flip the sign of $a_{i,j}$ (make $a_{i,j}=1$)
>
> ### Proof:
>
> If $F\in SAT$ then $f(F)\in INT$
>
> > If $F\in SAT$ then there is an assignment to the literals where each clause is true. 
>
> > If each clause is true, then at least one literal is true. This carries over to our system of inequalities $f(F)$. If all literals in a clause are simply the variable, this means for our inequality to be true at least one $x_i$ is equal to $1$, so the sum is at most $-1*1 \leq -1$ so this inequality is true. If the clause contains negations of a variable, then the inequality will still hold because we incremented $b_j$ by $1$ so that way the inequality accepts when that variable is $0$ (if the negated variable is true then the inequality requires one other non negated variable to be 1 in order for the inequality to hold, this way we do not accept when we should not). Thus if $F\in SAT$ the same assignment that makes $F$ true can be used to make $f(F)\in INT$ true.
>
> If $F\notin SAT$ then $f(F)\notin INT$
>
> > If $F\notin SAT$ then there is no assignment to the literals where each clause is true.
> > This means at least one clause is false in $F$, that is all literals are false for this clause. In $f(F)$, there must also exist an inequality that is false. If there are no negations of variables in our clause $c$, then the inequality would contain all $x_i=0$ so $0+0+...+0\leq -1$. For each negation, $b_c$ is incremented by $1$, so if there are $y$ negations we get the inequality $y+0+0+...+0\leq y-1$ which is false. Thus if $F\notin SAT$ then $f(F)\notin INT$
>
> If $f(F) \in INT$ then $F\in SAT$
>
> If $f(F)\notin INT$ then $F\notin SAT$
>
> Therefore, $F\in SAT\leftrightarrow f(F)\in INT$ so $SAT\leq_p INT$.
