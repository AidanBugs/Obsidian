### A. What crime has Luigi Mangione been arrested for, and how did technology play a role in his capture and being charged with the crime? You can use any source to answer this question.
Luigi Mangione was arrested for murdering the CEO of UnitedHealth. Technology played multiple roles in his arrest. For starters the police were able to arrest him because an employee at McDonalds recognized Mangione and called the police on him. However the employee was only able to recognize him because of the images NYPD released of him. Of course, these photos were taken with a surveillance camera. This shows how technology played in a role in Mangione's arrest by getting images of the suspect, spreading these images to the public, and allowing the police to be called in order to arrest Mangione.

### B. Do you think the technology that led to his arrest is invasive or an important part of making us safe?
I think the technology used was not invasive and are an important part of keeping us safe. Survellance cameras are a tool that oftentimes act as a deterrent to crimes as crimnals are less likely to commit crimes when they are being watched. Where as communication tools are things everyone uses to communicate with one another and are not invasive.

### Please watch the video below. What is the difference between the stationary and differential tests, and what was the highest differential car speed for which the AutoVu SharpX camera correctly read the license plate?
Stationary tests are done where the camera is still and the car drives in front of it. Differential tests are done by simulating a police officer driving in the opposite direction of the car. The highest differential car speed for which the AutoVu SharpX camera correctly read the license plate is 205mph, where the first car was moving at 105mph and the second car was moving at 100mph.

### A. How did surveillance cameras help exonerate a suspect in a shooting on Bourbon Street?

### B. What is the “virtual time machine” (re man in red shirt), and how is AI used in this technology?

### C. For the cameras that train themselves to find anomalies or unusual movements, what types of things is this AI meant to detect? Is it (currently) meant to detect people acting suspiciously?

### D. Why might New Orleans community members be hesitant about the installation of cameras? Why might they be in support?

### A. What is the key idea in this program, and why can it considered to be the opposite of a big-data approach?

### B. Who did Michael Williams travel to Detroit with, why did they go, and why is it relevant?

### C. What were the impacts of this program on use-of-force incidents and citizen complaints? 

## 5
### A. Read the section “Fieldwork”. Where did the researcher carry out their study? The author describes three factors why this site is at the leading edge of data analytics -- what are these factors?

### B. Read the section “The Quantification of Individual Risk”. Describe the “point system” – how do individuals get points and how do the police use the point data?

### C. Read the section “Shift from Reactive to Predictive Analytics”. Describe risk-based deployment—how is risk determined, and how is this information used by police? 

### D. Read the section “Shift from Query-Based to Alert-Based Systems”. What is the difference between query-based systems and alert-based systems and give an example of each.

### E.  The author says, “queries themselves are becoming data”.  What does this mean, and why does the author find this concerning?

### F. Read the section “Lower Database Inclusion Thresholds”. How can the Palantir system lead to real-time alerts to police for people who had no prior contact with the police?

### A.  For positive and negative feedback loops, what do the words “positive” and “negative” imply? Describe one example given in the video for the positive feedback loop and one example for the negative feedback loop.

### B. In “Big Data Surveillance” the author says the point system leads to a feedback loop… does the author mean a positive or a negative feedback loop, and what is the author’s reasoning?

### C. Do you think the proponents of risk-based deployment believe it would lead to a negative feedback loop or a positive feedback loop (and why)?

### D. Do you think risk-based deployment would lead to a negative feedback effect loop or a positive feedback loop (and why)?
