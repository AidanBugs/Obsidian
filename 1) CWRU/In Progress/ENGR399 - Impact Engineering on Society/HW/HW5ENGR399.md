### A. What crime has Luigi Mangione been arrested for, and how did technology play a role in his capture and being charged with the crime? You can use any source to answer this question.
Luigi Mangione was arrested for murdering the CEO of UnitedHealth. Technology played multiple roles in his arrest. For starters the police were able to arrest him because an employee at McDonalds recognized Mangione and called the police on him. However the employee was only able to recognize him because of the images NYPD released of him. Of course, these photos were taken with a surveillance camera. This shows how technology played in a role in Mangione's arrest by getting images of the suspect, spreading these images to the public, and allowing the police to be called in order to arrest Mangione.

### B. Do you think the technology that led to his arrest is invasive or an important part of making us safe?
I think the technology used was not invasive and are an important part of keeping us safe. Survellance cameras are a tool that oftentimes act as a deterrent to crimes as crimnals are less likely to commit crimes when they are being watched. Where as communication tools are things everyone uses to communicate with one another and are not invasive.

### Please watch the video below. What is the difference between the stationary and differential tests, and what was the highest differential car speed for which the AutoVu SharpX camera correctly read the license plate?
Stationary tests are done where the camera is still and the car drives in front of it. Differential tests are done by simulating a police officer driving in the opposite direction of the car. The highest differential car speed for which the AutoVu SharpX camera correctly read the license plate is 205mph, where the first car was moving at 105mph and the second car was moving at 100mph.

### A. How did surveillance cameras help exonerate a suspect in a shooting on Bourbon Street?
There wass a shooting at 430 AM on bourbon street in New Orleans. A man called in who got shot claiming to be the victim but when they watched the camera footage it showed that this man shot first so he was not the victim.

### B. What is the “virtual time machine” (re man in red shirt), and how is AI used in this technology?
The virtual time machine allows the officers to trace back a person's movement across different cameras. AI is used to identify the individuals using descriptive artificial intelligence. The descriptive AI identifies the suspect by generating a description based on the pixels, this AI was also useed for the red truck example.

### C. For the cameras that train themselves to find anomalies or unusual movements, what types of things is this AI meant to detect? Is it (currently) meant to detect people acting suspiciously?
One example was people walking in an airport are meant to follow a general flow of traffic and if people move in a way that is out of the flow then they are likely to be found abnormal by the AI. How it works is the AI is trained off of activity for that camera for about 2 weeks and then once deployed any movement that was not normal in the 2 week period is considered abnormal and flagged by the AI. Andrew Sinclair Corporate VP @ Motorola said that AI being used to detect people acting suspiciously is very difficult because machine learning is not quite there yet. However, using AI to detect large crowds of people in an intersection where there aren't many people is easily flaggable.

### D. Why might New Orleans community members be hesitant about the installation of cameras? Why might they be in support?
People are hesitant about the installation of cameras because of privacy concerns. Simply, many don't want to be watched all the time. There are other concerns with the cameras calling many false reports or even amplifying racial biases. However, people are in support because they want to keep the city safe and having cameras is a way to easily track down culprits. Going back to 3A, the police said they would not be able to come to the right conclusion for the shooting case if it weren't for the cameras to help identify the suspect.

### A. What is the key idea in this program, and why can it considered to be the opposite of a big-data approach?
The main idea is police using Empathy and working with Acho, a leadership and empathy enthusiast. This can be the opposite of a big-data approach because the goal of this program is to bring the community together and help them feel more connected as opposed to the big-data approach which monitors its citizens in a almost dehumanizing way for officers. The dehumanizing comes from the fact that people on a screen don't feel as human as a real connection you would have with people in front of you.

### B. Who did Michael Williams travel to Detroit with, why did they go, and why is it relevant?
Michael Williams traveled with 13 young men to Detriot to go to the African American History Musuem, then took them out to eat. Many of these kids haven't even been outside of Cleveland. This is relevant because Michael Williams' goal is to bring the community together and help them feel more connected. This would contribute to the sense of empathy Acho wants to see.

### C. What were the impacts of this program on use-of-force incidents and citizen complaints? 
Use of force went down by 29%, citizen complaints went down by 45%.

### A. Read the section “Fieldwork”. Where did the researcher carry out their study? The author describes three factors why this site is at the leading edge of data analytics -- what are these factors?
The researcher carried out their study on the LAPD (Los Angelos Police Department). According to the reading, "The LAPD invests heavily in its data collection, analysis, and deployment capacities, and offers international training sessions on how law enforcement can better harness big data. Therefore, practices within the Department may forecast broader trends that may shape other law enforcement agencies in the coming years."

### B. Read the section “The Quantification of Individual Risk”. Describe the “point system” – how do individuals get points and how do the police use the point data?
The point system is used to determine which individuals are the most dangerous. The idea is that a few individuals are disproportionally responsible for violent crimes. Individuals can get points for a variety of ways such as: having a violent criminal history, known gang affiliation, prior arrests with a handgun, on porale or probation, or a point for having police contact. The police use this point data to determne which individuals are the most dangerous and should be monitored.

### C. Read the section “Shift from Reactive to Predictive Analytics”. Describe risk-based deployment—how is risk determined, and how is this information used by police? 
Risk-based deployment deploys officers where there is a high risk of crime occuring. The risk is determined by previous crime history in the surrounding area and time of occurence. This information is used by the police to determine where to deploy officers in the most effecient manor according to the data.

### D. Read the section “Shift from Query-Based to Alert-Based Systems”. What is the difference between query-based systems and alert-based systems and give an example of each.
Query based systems are systems revolving around users searching for information via a request or a query. An example of this would be the virtual time machine, where the officer would select an individual and query for their past locations across a multitude of cameras. The author gave the example of running someone's license plate in the system. Alert-based systems are systems where officers recieve real time notifications when certain variables or configurations are present. An example of this would be theh anomly detection system mentioned in the video. This is because officers recieve an alert when conditions are met, as opposed to actively looking for the information.

### E.  The author says, “queries themselves are becoming data”.  What does this mean, and why does the author find this concerning?
This means that when officers search for something in the system, their searches are becomming data. The author gave the example of an officer running a query, then later another officer running a similar query (mayb searching for the same data) and the system would notify the other officer that there was a previous officer running a similar query. Another example is searching someone's name in the database, then all officers could be able to see how many times that person was searched, with the arguement that if someone is being searched frequently they are probably doing something wrong. One of the reasons the author finds this concerning is because the amount of times a person has been queried is a form of data and can lead to suspicions for this individual. However, just because an individual was queryed multiple times does not necessarily mean they are doing something wrong, which can lead to a concern.

### F. Read the section “Lower Database Inclusion Thresholds”. How can the Palantir system lead to real-time alerts to police for people who had no prior contact with the police?
The Palantir system is a system which identifies individuals that are close to a person of interest. The system also identifies how these listed individuals relate to the person of interest (ex: siblings, colleagues, etc). Once these networks are added into the system, whenever an individual is contacted by police or other government agencies, the system will notify the police of thiis, showing how people who had no prior contact with the police can be identified.

### A.  For positive and negative feedback loops, what do the words “positive” and “negative” imply? Describe one example given in the video for the positive feedback loop and one example for the negative feedback loop.
Postive feedback loops are called positive because they amplify a particular affect from previous conditions. The video gives the example of plants. When plants die, their death gives more nutrients to the soil, allowing more plants to grow. More plants leads to more death, which leads to more nutrients, which leads to even more plants. Negative feedback loops diminishes changes to the system, causing a more stable system. The example the video gave was predators and prey, where when predators eat the prey, which leads to less prey for the predators to feed on. Thus more predators die, which leads to more prey, which leads to more predators. Then the cycle repeats causing the system to maintain itself.

### B. In “Big Data Surveillance” the author says the point system leads to a feedback loop… does the author mean a positive or a negative feedback loop, and what is the author’s reasoning?
This is a positive feedback loop because if an individual has a high point value, then they are more likely to be contacted by police. If they have police interactions then their point value goes up. Thus this is a positive feedback loop because it is amplifying the points of hihgh point individuals. This is exactly what the author said that a high point value is a predictor of future police contact, raising the point value.

### C. Do you think the proponents of risk-based deployment believe it would lead to a negative feedback loop or a positive feedback loop (and why)?
The idea of risk-based deployment is to create a negative feed back loop. This stems from the fact that officers are only deployed in area where crime might occur. Then with more officers in these crime areas, crime will decrease because of the increased presence of officers. This leads to less crime occuring, then less officers, then more crime, etc. This demonstrates a negative feedback loop as it is maintaining a stable low crime syste.

### D. Do you think risk-based deployment would lead to a negative feedback effect loop or a positive feedback loop (and why)?
I believe that risk based deployment would lead to a positive feedback loop. This is because if officers are deployed in areas, then they will report more crimes in those areas. With more reported crimes in those areas, the officers will be deployed there more. This is a positive feedback loop because it is amplifying the deployment of officers in an area.
