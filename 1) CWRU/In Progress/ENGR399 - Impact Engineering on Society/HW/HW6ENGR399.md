# (3) Section 2.1  
(a) David finds himself in a difficult position because he suspects that his colleague and friend, Kevin, is not taking sufficient care in his role as an examining engineer, potentially compromising the safety of rail bridges. David must decide whether to report Kevin’s behavior to their superiors, balancing his professional duty to ensure safety with his loyalty to his friend.  

(b) Two issues mentioned in the "Discussion" are:  
1. The conflict between professional duties and personal loyalty to a colleague or friend.  
2. The need to determine whether the breach of duty is due to Kevin’s personal failings or a systemic issue within the organization, which affects the appropriate course of action.

# (4) Section 2.2  
(a) If I were the engineer hired by Pellar Paper Ltd, I would apply the principle of "perform services only in areas of current competence" by refusing to complete the traffic impact assessment myself, as I do not feel competent in this area. Instead, I would insist that Pellar Paper hire a specialist consultant to handle this aspect of the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA).  

(b) The "Discussion" claims that options 1 and 2 may amount to the same thing because if the engineer refuses to complete the traffic assessment (option 1), Pellar Paper is unlikely to accept an incomplete report (option 2). Both options could result in the engineer being unable to continue working on the project unless the client agrees to hire a specialist.

# (5) Section 2.3  
The problem with approving training only for Sarah McKay’s team is that it may be seen as unfair to other teams in similar positions who also need training to maintain their skills. This could lead to dissatisfaction among employees and undermine the principle of fairness, while also failing to address the broader need for up-to-date skills across the company.

# (6) Section 2.4  
I would choose option 2: inform STZ that I do not agree with their public statements and urge them to reconsider their position. This option balances the need to address the misleading information with the obligation to maintain a professional relationship with the client. It also avoids the ethical and legal risks of remaining silent while giving STZ the opportunity to correct their statements.

# (7) Section 2.5  
(a) The principle requires the engineer to present their professional judgment honestly and accurately, even if it conflicts with the client’s wishes. In this case, the engineer believes that Jane Foster’s request for minimal security is overconfident and risky, and they must communicate this concern objectively.  

(b) The dilemma arises because Jane Foster, as the CEO, has the final say on the project, but the engineer believes that her request compromises the security of the system. The engineer must decide whether to insist on additional security measures, potentially risking the client relationship, or to comply with the CEO’s request, which they believe is unsafe.

# (8) Section 2.6  
(a) I would sound the alarm by presenting the risks to my manager in terms of the ethical responsibility to protect the hospital and its patients, emphasizing the potential for harm if the hospital loses power. I would recommend intensive working practices to complete the overhaul within 12 hours.  

(b) The downside of framing ethical concerns in terms of commercial repercussions is that it may not accurately reflect the engineer’s judgment, which is based on the ethical duty to protect public safety. It could also be seen as manipulative or dishonest.

# (9) Section 3.1  
(a) The dilemma is whether to continue working on a surveillance system for elderly people, knowing that some users may not fully understand or consent to being monitored, potentially invading their privacy.  

(b) I would refuse to work on the project because the potential invasion of privacy, especially for vulnerable individuals, outweighs the benefits of the system. Ethical considerations about consent and privacy are paramount in this situation.

# (10) Section 3.2  
Pros of taking the client to court:  
- It upholds ethical principles by refusing to participate in corruption.  
- It ensures that the company is paid for its work.  

Cons of taking the client to court: 
- It could damage the company’s reputation and relationships in the region.  
- Legal proceedings may be costly and time-consuming, with no guarantee of success.

# (11) Section 3.3  
(a)  
-Factual issue: The Mayor is asking for a hospital to be built in exchange for granting a mining license, bypassing the legal process.  
-Conceptual issue: Whether the Mayor’s request constitutes a bribe or improper influence.  
-Ethical issue: The engineer must decide whether to comply with the Mayor’s request, which may be unethical or illegal, or to seek alternative legal channels.  

(b) I would navigate the scenario by investigating the proper legal channels for obtaining the license and refusing to comply with the Mayor’s request if it involves bypassing legal procedures. I would also consider the long-term reputational and legal risks of participating in what could be seen as a bribe.

# (12) Section 3.4  
The scenario involves a senior engineer who must decide whether to disclose the risk of additional funding needs for an R&D project to the board. The principle of acting in a reliable and trustworthy manner requires the engineer to be honest about the risks, even if it may jeopardize the project’s approval. This ensures transparency and upholds the trust placed in the engineer by the employer.

# (13) Section 4.1  
(a) The dilemma is whether to bid for a public sector contract with unnecessarily complex requirements, which could bring in more revenue but result in a poor product, or to propose a simpler, more effective solution that may be less profitable.  

(b) The "higher standard of justification" refers to ensuring that the work is not only lawful but also serves the public good, avoiding unnecessary complexity and waste of public funds.

# (14) Section 4.2  
(a) Jean Smith believes the environmental impact might not be negligible because the tunnel entrance is near a rare grassland habitat, and similar projects have led to increased traffic and pollution.  

(b) Jean is anxious because reporting negative impacts could lead to losing the client and future work, as well as damaging her reputation in the industry.

### (15) Section 4.3  
Option 1 (use SFI-certified wood from the original country):
-Pro: It meets the like-with-like requirement for preserving the building’s heritage.  
-Con: The SFI certification may not be as reliable as FSC, raising concerns about sustainability.  

Option 2 (use FSC-certified wood from a different country):
-Pro: It ensures the wood is sustainably sourced, aligning with environmental policies.  
-Con: The wood may not perfectly match the original, potentially affecting the building’s historical accuracy.

# (16) Section 4.4  
(a) The principle suggests sharing information with competitors because it not only helps prevent future accidents at Kudochem’s plants but also protects the health and safety of others who may be affected by similar issues at competitors’ plants.  

(b) One issue raised in the "Wider applications" section is determining an appropriate level of safety, balancing financial costs with the need to protect public health and safety.

# (17) Section 4.5  
(a) The dilemma is whether to follow orders to replace pump casing studs with poor-quality replacements, risking safety, or to raise concerns, potentially jeopardizing one’s career.  

(b) I would choose option 2: inform my superior of my concerns and recommend delaying the work until evidence of the studs’ quality is provided. This balances the duty to ensure safety with the need to follow proper channels.

# (18) Section 5.1  
The doctor-patient relationship is relevant because it illustrates the importance of informed consent and respecting the views of those affected by decisions, even if they lack technical expertise. Similarly, engineers must listen to public concerns about technologies like nuclear power, even if they believe the public is misinformed.

# (19) Section 5.2  
It is important for engineers to inform the public about developments in surveillance technologies because the public may not be aware of the potential risks, such as privacy violations. Engineers have a responsibility to ensure that society is prepared to address the ethical and social implications of new technologies.

# (20) Section 5.3  
(a) The first course of action (concealing the dual roles) is unacceptable because it violates the principle of objectivity and truthfulness by withholding relevant information from clients.  

(b) The best option may be to go further by offering independent verification of recommendations to ensure impartiality, as this would demonstrate a commitment to objectivity and build trust with clients.
