Read Chapter 2, sections 1 & 5-7Links to an external site. of Aristotle’s famous treatise on ethics, Nicomachean Ethics.

## A.
### (i)
In section 1, Aristotle likens exhibiting virtuous traits to constructing buildings and playing musical instruments. What is the point of this analogy? Relatedly, how does exhibiting virtuous character traits differ from our ability to see or hear, according to Aristotle?

> [!Ans]
> For our ability to see / hear, we are able to do these things before we have used them repeatedly, however virtuous traits develop through habitually using them. Essentially Aristotle says that we learn virtuous traits by doing them (like learning to build buildings and learning to play instruments).

## B.
### (i)
In section 5, Aristotle talks about “three kinds” of “things” that are found in the human “soul” (which you can just interpret as our “minds” or our “psychological makeup”). What are these?

> [!Ans]
> The 3 kinds of things found in the human soul are passions, faculties, and states of character.

### (ii)
Re: the question above, why does Aristotle claim that virtues must be one of these things, but not the other two?

> [!Ans]
> Aristotle claims virtues can not be a passion because we are not called good / bad based on our passions, but we are called good / bad based on our virtues. Similarly, faculties we have by nature, but we are not good / bad by nature, therefore our virtues are not faculties. As such, virtues must be a state of character because it cannot be the other 2.

### (iii)
In section 6, what sort of state does Aristotle identify with virtue? That is to say, he argues that vice can take two extremes (when it comes to “passions” or “actions” that we might take in our lives), and that virtue has a particular relation to these two extremes, relative to each individual. What are the two extremes of vice, and how does virtue relate to them?

> [!Ans]
> Aristotle identifies virtue as a state of character concerned with choice. The two extremes of vices are excess and defect. Aristotle says virtue both finds and chooses the intermediate, stating that virtue is a mean (average) with regard to the excess and defect (best / worst).

## C.
### (i)
In section 7, Aristotle gives a number of examples of virtues and their corresponding vices. Describe two virtues and their corresponding vices in your own words (using contemporary language, rather than Aristotle’s rather idiosyncratic vocabulary of “empty vanity,” “ready-witted,” and so on).

> [!Ans]
> One example he gives of virtues and their vices is the virtue of courage, which is the mean of fear and confidence. Courage is the mean of excessive confidence (which Aristotle described as rash and without regard for danger) and cowardice (defect / lack or confidence). Another example he gives is pains, temperance, pleasures. Excessive pleasures is self indulgence, and people who are defective to pleasure Aristotle described as "insensible". The mean of "insensible" and self indulgent (vices) is temperance (virtue).

Note that Aristotle foregrounds an interesting phenomenon: he claims that there are various virtues that fall in-between the extremes of vices, but observes that, in some cases, we don’t have words to describe either these extremes or the corresponding virtues. This gets at an important distinction between words and concepts: we might have a concept for something, but—as a matter of contingent fact—we don’t have any word to linguistically represent that concept. For example, we all can grasp the concept of (just making this up somewhat randomly) “everything that’s currently on my desk at work.” This includes a coffee mug, a computer, some external hard drives, etc. We can make sense of this concept. But the English language doesn’t have a single word that I might use in a sentence to refer to “everything that’s currently on my desk at work.” Instead, I have to actually use that entire phrase if I want to refer to my coffee mug, computer, etc. collectively (as in: “Don’t throw away everything that’s currently on my desk at work.” If we had a specific word for this concept, I could utter this sentence with fewer words!).

All of this is to say that Aristotle reports that, in the language he’s using—ancient Greek—there is no word for “excessive fearlessness” (or, as he puts it, the state of someone “who exceeds in fearlessness [which] has no name”). However, note that the English language, unlike ancient Greek, does have words for some of the virtues and vices that Aristotle references. For example, we have a word that comes very close to “excessive fearlessness”—namely, “temerity,” or in its adjectival form, “temerarious,” which Merriam-Webster defines as “unreasonable or foolhardy contempt of danger or opposition.” The point is this: be careful to distinguish between words and concepts—just because we don’t have a word for some virtue or vice, that doesn’t mean the virtue or vice doesn’t exist. 

### (ii)
Give one example of how thinking about virtues as the “golden mean” might influence your actions, goals, etc. as an engineer or scientist? You might mention that, for example, some people pursue science and engineering as a way to earn lots of money, thus enabling them to buy fancy cars, boost their social status, etc. What would Aristotle say about this? If being virtuous is an essential part of living the “Good Life” (as Aristotle believed), is the pursuit of wealth, status, power, etc. compatible with attaining the Good Life?

> [!Ans]
> The pursuit of wealth would not be part of living the good life according to Aristotle. This is because is we are thinking about being virtuous as a mean between excess and defect, then to be virtuous would be to pursue the mean of excessive wealth and defective wealth. Defective wealth could be living in poverty, or maybe living check to check. As such according to Aristotle in order to live virtuously we should not pursue excess wealth as that would be a vice.
### (iii)
Open-ended question: how convincing do you find Aristotle’s version of virtue ethics? Does it resonate with you? Do you think that being virtuous, through lots of everyday practice, by avoiding the extremes of excess and deficiency is the only way to attain the Good Life?
> [!Ans]
> I think some parts of Aristotle's virtue ethics are applicable while some are less so. For example, if one grew up in poverty, they might naturally gravitate toward wealth in an attempt to make themselves and their family experience the wealthy life. Aristotle would argue this would not lead to living the good life while for this family this might be all that they've ever wanted. I believe that strictly following this virtue ethics code could lead to a life of mediocraty as one would never live to their fullest potential. Take another example intelligence / wisdom. If you pursue excess wisdom / intelligence this is a vice, which is contradictory toward the life of a philosopher who wishes to learn more about the world. As such, I believe in order to live a good life it is almost a necessity to chase one excess vice. For philosophers like aristotle it might be intelligence, while for others it could be strength, wealth, etc. However, I do also believe in order to live the good life one must not be boastful or arrogant about their excess.

From the open-access textbook "An Introduction to Utilitarianism": Read the chapter “Introduction to UtilitarianismLinks to an external site.” starting from the beginning and stopping before the section titled “Roadmap.” Then read the chapter “Elements and Types of UtilitarianismLinks to an external site..”
## A.
### (i)
Why do the authors argue that utilitarianism has a good historical track record? Give a few examples. 

> [!Ans]
> One example the author gave was Jeremy Bentham, who advocated for the separation of church and state, abolotion of slavery, opposed capital punishment, legal regulations to protect criminals and non-human animals from cruelty, and decriminilization of homosexuality. This was all done by Jeremy Bentham, there are other examples the author gives about John Stuart Mill, who defended the provision of social welfare for the poor and promoted freedom of speech. 

### (ii)
Does consequentialism take acts—such as breaking a promise—to be right or wrong in themselves (i.e., intrinsically right or wrong)? Deontologists would argue that some acts are intrinsically right or wrong. How does consequentialism differ from this?

> [!Ans]
> Consequentialists believe that breaking a promise is not wrong in itself because if breaking a promise results in the saving of a life then breaking a promise is good. However consequentialists agree that most of the time breaking a promise has bad consequences. Since deontologists argue that certain acts are intrinsically right or wrong, this contradicts consequentialism which determines if an individual act is right or wrong based on the results / consequences of that action. Essentially, given some act deontologists would say is intrinsically wrong a consequentialist would argue that if performing that act results in something that is really good would make that wrong act good. For example, a consequentialist could argue killing someone to save 10 lives would make killing someone worth it. Whereas a deontologist could argue that no matter how many lives one would save one should never kill someone as that is an intrinsically wrong action.

Note: the authors write: “Much of consequentialism’s appeal may stem from the conviction that making the world a better place is simply more important than any of these competing moral goals.” This sounds very appealing at first glance—you might even think, “How could anyone disagree with this?” But recall from class our example of the doctor and her five sick patients: sometimes “making the world a better place” means violating common moral intuitions, such as that one should never murder—even if doing so would enable you to harvest a healthy patient’s organs to save five other people, which would result in more total good.

## B.
### (i)
What is the main difference between act utilitarianism (a kind of “direct utilitarianism”) and rule utilitarianism (a kind of “indirect utilitarianism”)? Why do the authors believe that, despite its name, rule utilitarianism shouldn’t be classified as a type of utilitarianism?

> [!Ans]
> Act utilitarianism directly assesses the moral rightness of actions, whereas indirect / rule utilitarianism determines if an act is right or wrong based on a preditermined set of rules that would determine the best utilitarian consequences. Essentially, determining moral correctness based on the general results of an act rather than the individual results of an individual act. The authors believe that rule utilitarianism shouldn't be classified as a type of utilitarianism because it goes against the idea of consequentialism / utilitarianism which is attempting to reach the best outcome possible. Instead, rule consequentialism focuses on following a strict (but plausible) set of moral rules. 

### (ii)
What does welfarism—which all utilitarians accept—take to be “intrinsically good” and “intrinsically bad”? Do you agree, or do you think that there may be other things in the world that are also intrinsically good or bad?

> [!Ans]
> Welfarism holds that positive well-being is the only intrinsiic good and negative well-being is the only intrinsic bad. While I agree those are intrinsically good and bad, I believe there are more things in the world that are intrinsically good and bad. For example, genocide I believe is intrinsically bad but welfarism seems to believe negative well-being is the only intrinsic bad. For example, in Marvel's Avengers infinity war, the antagonist (thanos) killed half of the population so that way the other half would live happily (no more fighting over food / resources). While welfarism might approve of this (if more than half the population survives) becauses majority of people would have good well-being which is intrinsicly good. 

Note: How exactly does welfarism fit with utilitarianism? The idea is this: determining how one ought to act in any given situation is a two-step process, according to utilitarians. You can think of this as a kind of “algorithm.” Imagine that you’re in a situation where you have a couple of options: you could either take some action A or, alternatively, you could take some different action B. Which is the right action to take? Step one: evaluate the consequences of A and B. Would the consequences of A be better than the consequences of B? Would A result in more total wellbeing (i.e., welfare) than B? Or the other way around?

Step two: let’s say that you determine, to the best of your ability, that A would have better consequences than B—i.e., that A would result in more total value or wellbeing than B—then utilitarianism says that A is the morally right action to take. On this account, what is good or bad is a separate judgment from what is right or wrong.

The key idea that links these together is that utilitarians say that “Whatever is the most good, just is the morally right action.” In this way, utilitarianism bases what is right on what is good: if an act results in maximum goodness (wellbeing), then it is the right act to take. If it doesn’t result in maximum goodness (wellbeing), then it is the wrong act to take. So, utilitarianism consists of two fundamental components: a claim about what is good (this is the welfarism component!), and a claim about moral rightness: that moral rightness comes down entirely to what produces the most good (welfare).

This is why philosophers like to say that utilitarianism “builds the right on the good.” In contrast, deontology (below) rejects this view, claiming instead that sometimes the morally right thing to do is not what produces the most good—as in the case of the doctor and her five patients!

For a fun critique of hedonism—the view that we should understand “welfare” as happiness or pleasure (two words that philosophers use interchangeably)—see the famous “experience machineLinks to an external site.” thought experiment from the philosopher Robert Nozick, who very much rejected hedonism!

### (iii)
What is the difference between something being good for some person and something being good in a more general, abstract, impersonal sense?

> [!Ans]
> The example the authors give is punishing an evil person. While some may see their punishment as good (as it is a punishment for someone bad) but the punishment is good because it is bad for the evil person. Another way to think about this distinction is giving someone new glasses. Having better sight would certainly benefit one's well being, but new glasses would only really benefit people who need glasses. Thats the difference betweenn good for some person vs good in a more general sense. 

Additional clarification: philosophers would call this second sense of something being good: “good simpliciter,” where “simpliciter” means something like “inherently” or “per se.” If something is “good simpliciter,” it just is good, independent of whether or how it might be good for particular people. This may seem hard to wrap your head around at first, but we use this sense of “good” all the time. For example, you might say to your friend, Alex, during a time of personal crisis that Alex is going through: “It is good that you exist in the world.” You might think that Alex’s existence is good for her, and maybe also good for you, since you’re friends. But your statement goes beyond this: it suggests that the world itself is a better place with Alex in it. In other words, apart from Alex’s existence being good for her and her friends, there’s a more general, abstract, or impersonal sense in which Alex’s existence is “good.” This is the idea of “good simpliciter,” and many philosophers believe that it’s important to distinguish it with another common use of the word “good,” as in: “It was good that I saw the doctor”—which is to say, it was good for me that I saw the doctor, because the doctor (let’s assume) cured an illness that I was dealing with.

### (iv)
In your own words, what does “impartiality” and “aggregationism” mean? Define both.

> [!Ans]
> Impartiality is the view that everyone's well-being is equally important. Whereas aggregationism is the belief that the aggregate sum of all people involved represents the value of an outcome.

### (v)
Consider this example: imagine that you’re standing in front of a burning building with two children trapped in it. One of these children is your own, and the other is a stranger’s child. Unfortunately, you can only save one child. If you are truly impartial, then it doesn’t matter—morally speaking—whether you save your child or the stranger’s child. You should just flip a coin and say, “If it lands on heads, I’ll save my child. If it lands on tails, I’ll save the other child!”

But how do you feel about this? Does this example make you think that, in fact, ethics should actually be partial, as opposed to what utilitarians claim? Maybe you have “special obligations” to people around you—that is, obligations that you don’t have to strangers? Or maybe the utilitarians are right and, from an impartial point of view, it doesn’t matter which child you save, so long as you save one of them. What do you think?

> [!Ans]
> I agree that ethics are subjective and should be partial. I believe there is an arguement that its almost more unethical to save someone else's child over your own in that scenario. If one is truly impartial, any and all memories or effort gone into raising this child doesn't make any difference when it comes to picking whose life to save.

### (i)
Recap question: what are the four defining characteristics of utilitarianism?

> [!Ans]
> 1. Consequentialism
> 2. Welfarism
> 3. Impartiality
> 4. Aggreggationism

### (ii)
Open-ended question: what do you find compelling and/or problematic about utilitarianism? Do you think this is a better account of ethics than Aristotle’s virtue ethics?

(For utilitarians, it’s not about developing a virtuous moral character, it’s about whether the consequences of your actions are overall good or bad. Hence, someone we might universally describe as a “bad person” might actually be “more ethical” than someone we’d intuitively describe as “very good,” if the bad person’s actions were to have better consequences. Imagine a billionaire who treats his employees terribly for four decades, but then gives away $100 million to charity, whereas the “good person” makes very little money and hence only donates $1,000 to charity. In this case, one might argue that the billionaire has maximized wellbeing more than the poor person, and hence are “more ethical.” Do you agree with this idea? Are the consequences of one’s actions really all that matter?)

> [!Ans]
> While utilitarianism is a fairly easy moral code to apply, there are a lot of flaws with it. Such as the issues mentioned above about saving your child vs someone else's or Thanos's genocide. Personally, I think Aristotle's virtue ethics are a lot easier to follow as a general guideline. This is because living in the average of 2 extremes lead to alot less questionable moral choices. This is because the consequences of actions in Aristotle's virtue ethics are a lot less important. Instead what matters is intentionality, which in my opinion, is more important for ethics than purely consequences. 

Read the highlighted (in green and orange) sections of Immanuel Kant’s Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals Download sections of Immanuel Kant’s Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals.

Note: Kant starts off by arguing that the only thing in the universe that is good in itself is a “good will.” That is to say, we might have a “will” to do certain things—to pursue money, power, honor, etc.—or to exhibit certain “virtuous” traits like courage, resolution, and perseverance. But if what drives us to pursue or exhibit these things is, say, a will to take advantage of others, then even things like courage can “be extremely evil and harmful.” Hence, what Kant is getting at is that the goodness of the will that drives or motivates our actions is what ultimately matters with respect to being moral.

# 3
## A.
### (i)
Kant makes a distinction between doing something out of a sense of (moral) duty—or, in his words, “from duty”—and doing something that merely conforms with duty but is driven by self-interested motives. In your own words, can you explain this distinction? It might help to work through a concrete example (but not the one that Kant uses, please!).

> [!Ans]
> Acting with a sense of moral duty simply means doing something with a sense of obligation or moral code (from duty). Whereas doing something that conforms with duty means that the action alligns with one should do out of moral duty, however the reason for their action is more selfish. For example, after bumping into someone one should apologize because it is the morally right thing to do and one should feel sorry for bumping into someone. However, an exmple of acting with conformity toward the duty would be apologizing because you don't want people to think bad of you for not apologizing. Same action, different reasons. This is the distinction Kant is trying to make.

Note: This distinction is very important for Kant. It’s partly what makes his view different from utilitarianism: even if the consequences of some action are very good, if that action isn’t motivated by a genuine sense of duty, then it lacks “moral content” (in his words)—it’s not the sort of thing that one should be praised, in a moral sense, for having done. Imagine that I donate $10 million to a hospital that treats children with cancer. This might have very good consequences, as it might save the lives of many children. But now imagine that the only reason I did this was to become famous for helping children—that is, to boost my reputation as a great philanthropist. Even though the consequences were in fact good, Kant would say that this was not a morally praiseworthy act, because it was motivated by self-interest—i.e., by my will to benefit myself by boosting my reputation—rather than from a sense of duty to help others. This is why Kant writes: “Thus the moral worth of an action does not lie in the effect expected from it and so too does not lie in any principle of action that needs to borrow its motive from this expected effect.”

Note also Kant’s use of the term “prudent” on page 15. Mentioning this because it might be useful: philosophers distinguish between two broad categories. The first is denoted by terms like “prudent,” “prudence,” and “prudential.” This concerns questions about what is best for you. Hence, in a prudential sense, it might not be good for you to lie because sometimes lies can backfire. The second category, which contrasts with the first, concerns what is “ethical” or “moral.” Ethics and morality—unlike prudence—is fundamentally about how one treats others, i.e., about what is right or wrong when the interests of others are taken into account. What is right or wrong in this sense may not be what’s best for you, personally—maybe it’s best for you to lie and cheat, but doing so would be morally wrong when one takes into account the interests of others—specifically, the interests that others have in not being lied to or cheated out of something!

## B.
### (i)
On pages 25-26, Kant distinguishes between “hypothetical” and “categorical” imperatives. In your own words, can you explain this distinction?

> [!Ans]
> Hypothetical imperative relies on some sort of goal for the action. Whereas categorical impertatives do not. For example, a hypothetical imperative is "If you want to do well in classes then you should study alot", suggesting one to study to achieve success. Whereas a categorical imperative is "Never tell lies", which doesn't depend on a concrete goal to explain.

### (ii)
Toward the bottom of page 15, and onto page 16, Kant introduces his famous “categorical imperative” (though he doesn’t use that term just yet). His argument is that you and I—indeed, any rational being—can determine what is morally right or wrong through thought alone; that is, by using our reason or rationality to work through a kind of “algorithm.” Here is what you should do:

First, if you’re thinking about taking some action, formulate a “maxim” that describes that action. If I decide to lie to my friend about returning the $10 that he generously gave me to buy lunch (that is, I have no plans on ever returning this money!), then I might formulate a maxim like: “I will lie for personal gain.” Second, Kant said that, in order to determine whether this act is morally right or wrong, we should “universalize” this maxim, by which he meant imagining that everyone where to lie to their friends for personal gain. Third, his key original claim was that if universalizing this maxim leads to a logical contradiction, then anyone who acts in accordance with the maxim—lying for personal gain—is doing something morally wrong. This is the “algorithm” that he put forward.

So, let’s take a closer look to see whether everyone lying to their friends for personal gain leads to a contradiction. Kant would say that it does! Why? Because if everyone lied to each other, then no one would ever trust what other people tell them. And if no one ever trusted anyone else, then lying itself would become impossible. That is to say, how could you possibly lie to anyone if no one believes anyone else in the first place? Therein lies the contradiction: everyone lying makes lying itself impossible.

The question for you is this: try your best to work through this same procedure with a different example—such as cheating on a test rather than lying to someone. What is the general maxim that you’d give for cheating on a test? Is there a contradiction when you universalize this maxim? (If you’re thinking that these two cases overlap, that’s because they do. So, use lying as a template for thinking about cheating.)

> [!Ans]
> First the maxim for cheating on a test would be "I will cheat on this test in order to get a better grade on this test." Then universalizing this maxim would be a world in which everyone cheats to get better grades. This leads to a contradiction because if everyone cheats, their grades would not matter as much because tests would not accurately show a person's skill / knowledge. Thus tests would not matter as much and cheating for a better grade on a test wouldn't matter because tests dont matter. Thus creating a contradicion.

## C.
### (i)
Open-ended question: do you find Kant’s deontological ethics more compelling than virtue ethics or utilitarianism? Why or why not? What are the flaws and strengths of deontological ethics, and how do they compare with the flaws and strengths of virtue ethics and utilitarianism?

> [!Ans]
> Currently, I seem to most compelled by virtue ethics (though not entirely convinced) due to the general adaptability and sound moral reasoning. One of the bigger flaws with Kant's deontological ethics is the rigidity of thinking. Additionally, with Kant ethics, there is no way to know if a person's actions are good or bad because we do not know intentionality, a world filled with this skepticism seems quite bad to me. Utilitarianism differs here because it does not care about intentions, only outcome of event. So while ignoring intentionality of actions is a flaw of utilitarianism, it can be seen as a strength to not worry about such things. On the other hand Aristotle's virtue ethics more focuses on avoiding our vices (excess and defect) by pursuing their average. As such, it is alot less rigid than Kant's strict sense of duty and obligations one must follow.
