Read Chapter 2, sections 1 & 5-7Links to an external site. of Aristotle’s famous treatise on ethics, Nicomachean Ethics.

## A.
(i) In section 1, Aristotle likens exhibiting virtuous traits to constructing buildings and playing musical instruments. What is the point of this analogy? Relatedly, how does exhibiting virtuous character traits differ from our ability to see or hear, according to Aristotle?

> For our ability to see / hear, we are able to do these things before we have used them repeatedly, however virtuous traits develop through habitually using them. Essentially Aristotle says that we learn virtuous traits by doing them (like learning to build buildings and learning to play instruments).

## B.
(i) In section 5, Aristotle talks about “three kinds” of “things” that are found in the human “soul” (which you can just interpret as our “minds” or our “psychological makeup”). What are these?

> The 3 kinds of things found in the human soul are passions, faculties, and states of character.

(ii) Re: the question above, why does Aristotle claim that virtues must be one of these things, but not the other two?

> Aristotle claims virtues can not be a passion because we are not called good / bad based on our passions, but we are called good / bad based on our virtues. Similarly, faculties we have by nature, but we are not good / bad by nature, therefore our virtues are not faculties. As such, virtues must be a state of character because it cannot be the other 2.

(iii) In section 6, what sort of state does Aristotle identify with virtue? That is to say, he argues that vice can take two extremes (when it comes to “passions” or “actions” that we might take in our lives), and that virtue has a particular relation to these two extremes, relative to each individual. What are the two extremes of vice, and how does virtue relate to them?

> Aristotle identifies virtue as a state o

## C.
(i) In section 7, Aristotle gives a number of examples of virtues and their corresponding vices. Describe two virtues and their corresponding vices in your own words (using contemporary language, rather than Aristotle’s rather idiosyncratic vocabulary of “empty vanity,” “ready-witted,” and so on).

Note that Aristotle foregrounds an interesting phenomenon: he claims that there are various virtues that fall in-between the extremes of vices, but observes that, in some cases, we don’t have words to describe either these extremes or the corresponding virtues. This gets at an important distinction between words and concepts: we might have a concept for something, but—as a matter of contingent fact—we don’t have any word to linguistically represent that concept. For example, we all can grasp the concept of (just making this up somewhat randomly) “everything that’s currently on my desk at work.” This includes a coffee mug, a computer, some external hard drives, etc. We can make sense of this concept. But the English language doesn’t have a single word that I might use in a sentence to refer to “everything that’s currently on my desk at work.” Instead, I have to actually use that entire phrase if I want to refer to my coffee mug, computer, etc. collectively (as in: “Don’t throw away everything that’s currently on my desk at work.” If we had a specific word for this concept, I could utter this sentence with fewer words!).

All of this is to say that Aristotle reports that, in the language he’s using—ancient Greek—there is no word for “excessive fearlessness” (or, as he puts it, the state of someone “who exceeds in fearlessness [which] has no name”). However, note that the English language, unlike ancient Greek, does have words for some of the virtues and vices that Aristotle references. For example, we have a word that comes very close to “excessive fearlessness”—namely, “temerity,” or in its adjectival form, “temerarious,” which Merriam-Webster defines as “unreasonable or foolhardy contempt of danger or opposition.” The point is this: be careful to distinguish between words and concepts—just because we don’t have a word for some virtue or vice, that doesn’t mean the virtue or vice doesn’t exist. 

(ii) Give one example of how thinking about virtues as the “golden mean” might influence your actions, goals, etc. as an engineer or scientist? You might mention that, for example, some people pursue science and engineering as a way to earn lots of money, thus enabling them to buy fancy cars, boost their social status, etc. What would Aristotle say about this? If being virtuous is an essential part of living the “Good Life” (as Aristotle believed), is the pursuit of wealth, status, power, etc. compatible with attaining the Good Life?

(iii) Open-ended question: how convincing do you find Aristotle’s version of virtue ethics? Does it resonate with you? Do you think that being virtuous, through lots of everyday practice, by avoiding the extremes of excess and deficiency is the only way to attain the Good Life?
