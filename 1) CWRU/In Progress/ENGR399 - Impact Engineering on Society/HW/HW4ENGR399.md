# Kidneys bro
## 1 You can research this question from any source you like. Who is Borisa Simanic, why does he only have one kidney, and how does his experience show that someone can perform at the highest levels with only one kidney?

> Borisa Simanic is a Basketball player who suffered a severe injury during a game when he was elbowed in the kidney. After complications arose they ended up removing his kidney. Around a year later, he returned to the sport professionally, signing with Igokea, demonstrating that he was able to perform at the highest levels with only one kidney.

## 2 Watch Why You Can't Sell Your Organs! and answer the following questions:
### 1. What happened in the early 1980's in Virginia that spurred a new federal law? What was the new federal law, and what did it prohibit?

> A virginia doctor announced that he would begin buying organs from willing donors then selling them for profit. This caused the creation of a fedarl law that made it illegal to give compensation for the donation of organs, blood, or bone marrow.

### 2. What is UNOS, and what is their criteria for determining organ recipients? Are there ways to buy your way up the list?

> United network for organ sharing, a non profit which arranges organ sharing. They use criteria like medical status, distance, and time waited. Although there are no ways to buy your way up the list, there are ways to get aroud this using money. The video brought up the idea of transplant tourism where organ transplant laws arent as strict. Thus although there is no way to buy your way up the list, there is a way to get around the list using money.

### 3. The video cites ideas by Richard Thaler, a Nobel Prize winner who was an undergrad at CWRU! What was his idea to get more organ donations?

> Richard Thaler suggested an idea of "nudges" which are small subtle changes to lead people towards a good behaviour. One of the examples the video gave was about 401K, where people are less likely that employees would sign up for their companies 401K if they needed to opt in, however they are more likely to sign up if they were automatically enrolled with the option to opt out. In the case of organ donations, upon death their organs can still be donated. By using nudges to make it so people's organs are automatically donated upon death with the choice to opt out, people can be more likely to donate their organs

## 3 Read pages 37-48 of Repugnance as a Constraint on Markets Download Repugnance as a Constraint on Marketsby Alvin Roth (note that Roth won the Nobel Prize in Economics).
### 1.California has a law banning the human consumption of horse meat. What is the reason the author says the law was passed, and  is this reason consequentialist or deontological? 

> The reason the law was passed was because people founnd eating horse meat was repungant. The reasoning is deontological because it acts on the morals of eating horse meat being wrong and not the consequences of eating horse meat.

### 2. What policy did the author cite from the 1990 amendment to the Clean Air Act? Do you think this was ethical, and explain your reasoning?

> The policy the author cites from the 1990 amendment to the Clean Air Act was the right to trade emissions entitlement, which essentially is just trading the right to pollute. I think this is unethical as it is commodifying the right to pollute. This is a more deontological argument as it is arguing that polluting is wrong and we should not allow polluting to happen in order to reduce the pollution. From a consequentialist perspective, the argument is that polluting is wrong and we make polluting harder by requiring people to buy the right to pollute, thus reducing the amount of pollution.

### 3. What idea did the author cite from the 1991 World Bank memo under the signature of its chief economist say? Do you think this was ethical, and explain your reasoning? Was your answer regarding ethics the same as the previous answer (and give an explanation)?

> The memo suggested moving pollution to lower income countries. This is unethical because it is disregardingg the rights of those in poorer nations. Unlike tradable permits, this externalizes harm to vulnerable groups. While the both policies I believed to be unethical, I used different ethic frameworks to come to these conclusions. 

### 4. What does the author say are the Christian, Jewish and Muslim views on compensation for kidney donation? Give the relevant parts of the quotes from Pope John Paul and Rabbi Auerbach, and which is the Muslim country that the author says allows compensation for kidney donors?

> Christian: 
> Pope John Paul believed that organ donation was quite praise worthy. However, he stsrongly condemned actions that attempted to commercialize human organs. He said that to use the body as an object is to violate the dignity of the human person, thus he blieves it to be immoral to compensate for kidney donation.
>
> Jewish:
> Rabbi Shlomo Zalman Auerbach believes that recieving compensation for kidneys is fine. He went further to say it is not immoral to donate a kidney for the financial compensation rather it is the fault of the community to let a man reach the depths of despair to the point they sold their kidney for money.
>
> Muslim: 
> The author mentioned briefly that the Islamic Republic of Iran currently allows compensation for kidney donors.

### 5. Why are Kahn and Delmonico opposed to compensation for kidney donors? Do you think their answer would be different if there was a fixed compensation at a very high rate, for example, $200,000 for a kidney donation?

> Kahn and Delmonico believe that allowing compensation for kidney donors would be shifting the tragedy from those waiting for organs to those who were exploited into selling them. In the case of fixed compensation, Kahn and Delmocio likely would not change ttheir answer as this would still be shifting the tragedy.

### 6. What is the slippery slope argument against allowing compensation for kidney donations? Give an example cited in the text in this regard.

> The slippery slope arguement is that once compensation for kidneys is legal, then kidney sales could be part of contracts. Similar to the scenes portrayed in fiction shows/movies, people would be forced to sell their kidneys as collateral or to repay debts.

## 4 Read pages 1-2 and 17-28 of Medical Self Defense, Prohibited Experimental Therapies, and Payment for Organs Download Medical Self Defense, Prohibited Experimental Therapies, and Payment for Organs(note the Harvard Law Review perhaps the most prestigious law journal… Barack Obama was the President of the Harvard Law Review when he was in law school).
### 1. What are problems that Alice, Katherine, Ellen and Olivia face? Which ones have the legal right (e.g., in Ohio) to address their problem?

> Alice had a life threatening pregnancy and has the constitutional right to an abortion in order to save her life even though it is post-viability.
>
> Katherine has a home intruder who threatens her life and she has the legal right to self-defense, kill if neccessary.
>
> Ellen has a terminal illness with no proven cure / treatment, as such she has the constitutional right to use expirimental therapies.
>
> Olivia had kidney failure and the federal ban on organ payments limits the amount of available kidneys, thus risking her life.

### 2. What is the author’s idea of medical self-defense, and how does this relate to the problems that Alice, Katherine, Ellen and Olivia face?

> Medical self-defense is the idea that people are allowed to take actions to protect their own lives / health. This is a very consequentialist approach. This relates to Alice, Ellen, and Olvia as they are all going through various medical emergencies.

### 3. What does substantial burden mean in the kidney donor context, and how does the author explain this idea in regard to abortions and private school education?

> The substantial burden refers to the ban on organ payment, which consequently reduces the amount of available kidneys. The author compares this to abortion and private education by saying if these services were available to everyone for free, then the number of abortion providers and private schools will decrease, thus less people will get to use their right of free private education / abortion.

### 4. How does the author respond to the criticism that compensation for kidney donors would lead to only the rich getting needed kidneys?

> The author responds by saying that this is not a problem as a regulated compensattions system that would have health insurers or the government to ensure equal distribution of kidneys. Thus the rich would not be the only ones to getting kidneys.

### 5. The author addresses the criticism that compensation for kidney donors exploits more desperate people with several arguments. Describe his response in terms of the paternalism argument. Do you agree with the author?

> The author argues that this view is paternalistic because it implies that these desperate people would not make the educated choice to donate their kidneys. I do not agree with this argument because by legalizing compensation for kidneys, it is allowing thse desperate people to make a dangerous choice for money.

### 6. The Chair of the President’s Council on Bioethics is against compensation of kidney donors. How does he express this in terms of love and friendship? And how does the author respond to this? 

> The president's council against compensation is against compensation for kidney donors as it the human body is something that cannot be bought, like love or friendship. The author responds by arguing that medical self-defense is more important than philisophical debates.

## 5 Read the highlighted parts of Iranian Model of Paid and Regulated Living-Unrelated Kidney Donation Download Iranian Model of Paid and Regulated Living-Unrelated Kidney Donation, and answer the following questions:
### 1. How many renal transplants have there been in Iran during the study period, and what fraction of these were from paid donors (these are the "living-unrelated donations)?

> In Iran there were 19,609 renal transplants during the study period. Out of these 19,609, 15,356 (78.3%) were from paid donors while 3,421 (17.4%) were from living-related donors and 823 (4.2$) where from deceased donors.

### 2. Who is on the Donor Selection Panel and what is the panel seeking to exclude?

> The Donor Selection Panel is made up of transplant surgeons, nursing staff, nephrologists and they seek to exclude external pressure on donors, wishing that donors were voluntarily donating their kidneys.

### 3. Why do the authors argue that it is actually more ethical to pay unrelated kidney donors than to have friends or relatives donate without compensation? Do you agree with this argument?

> The authors argue that people feel obligated to donate their kidney if its for their friend / relative. Thus, it is more ethical to pay people to donate their kidneys because they are doing it because they believe the money is worth the kidney and not because they feel obligated to donate. I agree with this argument as people are able to better express their freedom of choice and not be caught up in obligations.

## 6 Do you think compensation for kidney donors should be allowed (beyond paying for travel and other costs)? Cite the argument from section 3, 4 or 5 (above) that aligns most with your views.

> I believe that compensation for kidney donors should be allowed beyond paying for travel and other costs. For example, the argument from question 4.3 is that by allowing for the compensation for kidney donors, more people would be willing to donate their kidneys and thus less people will be dying from a lack of available kidney transplants. To address the counter claim that this change would target those who are desperate for money, I am more in line with the Rabbi's perspective. The Rabbi suggested that if a person is donating their kidney purely out of desperation for money, then it is the society / communities fault for allowing this person to be exploited. Thus I believe that compensation for kidney donors should be allowed beyond paying for travel and other costs.
