# Kidneys bro
## 1 You can research this question from any source you like. Who is Borisa Simanic, why does he only have one kidney, and how does his experience show that someone can perform at the highest levels with only one kidney?

> Borisa Simanic is a Basketball player who suffered a severe injury during a game when he was elbowed in the kidney. After complications arose they ended up removing his kidney. Around a year later, he returned to the sport professionally, signing with Igokea, demonstrating that he was able to perform at the highest levels with only one kidney.

## 2 Watch Why You Can't Sell Your Organs! and answer the following questions:
### 1. What happened in the early 1980's in Virginia that spurred a new federal law? What was the new federal law, and what did it prohibit?

> A virginia doctor announced that he would begin buying organs from willing donors then selling them for profit. This caused the creation of a fedarl law that made it illegal to give compensation for the donation of organs, blood, or bone marrow.

### 2. What is UNOS, and what is their criteria for determining organ recipients? Are there ways to buy your way up the list?

> United network for organ sharing, a non profit which arranges organ sharing. They use criteria like medical status, distance, and time waited. Although there are no ways to buy your way up the list, there are ways to get aroud this using money. The video brought up the idea of transplant tourism where organ transplant laws arent as strict. Thus although there is no way to buy your way up the list, there is a way to get around the list using money.

### 3. The video cites ideas by Richard Thaler, a Nobel Prize winner who was an undergrad at CWRU! What was his idea to get more organ donations?

> Richard Thaler suggested an idea of "nudges" which are small subtle changes to lead people towards a good behaviour. One of the examples the video gave was about 401K, where people are less likely that employees would sign up for their companies 401K if they needed to opt in, however they are more likely to sign up if they were automatically enrolled with the option to opt out. In the case of organ donations, upon death their organs can still be donated. By using nudges to make it so people's organs are automatically donated upon death with the choice to opt out, people can be more likely to donate their organs

## 3 Read pages 37-48 of Repugnance as a Constraint on Markets Download Repugnance as a Constraint on Marketsby Alvin Roth (note that Roth won the Nobel Prize in Economics).
### 1.California has a law banning the human consumption of horse meat. What is the reason the author says the law was passed, and  is this reason consequentialist or deontological? 

> The reason the law was passed was because people founnd eating horse meat was repungant. The reasoning is deontological because it acts on the morals of eating horse meat being wrong and not the consequences of eating horse meat.

### 2. What policy did the author cite from the 1990 amendment to the Clean Air Act? Do you think this was ethical, and explain your reasoning?

> The policy the author cites from the 1990 amendment to the Clean Air Act was the right to trade emissions entitlement, which essentially is just trading the right to pollute. I think this is unethical as it is commodifying the right to pollute. This is a more deontological argument as it is arguing that polluting is wrong and we should not allow polluting to happen in order to reduce the pollution. From a consequentialist perspective, the argument is that polluting is wrong and we make polluting harder by requiring people to buy the right to pollute, thus reducing the amount of pollution.

### 3. What idea did the author cite from the 1991 World Bank memo under the signature of its chief economist say? Do you think this was ethical, and explain your reasoning? Was your answer regarding ethics the same as the previous answer (and give an explanation)?

> The memo suggested moving pollution to lower income countries. This is unethical because it is disregardingg the rights of those in poorer nations. Unlike tradable permits, this externalizes harm to vulnerable groups. While the both policies I believed to be unethical, I used different ethic frameworks to come to these conclusions.
