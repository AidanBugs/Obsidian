1. Why did Firestone believe they would be unaffected by the fighting in Liberia? (0 - 5 min)

There were a few reasons why they believed they would be unaffected. For starters, one of the employees interviewed mentioned how they had been through a few coups without anything happening so they thought this would be the same. They were one of the largest employers in the area for locals so they believed the government would just leave them alone and leave them to do what they were doing.

2. Describe the lifestyle of the Firestone managers. Do you think its unethical that they live a lifestyle like this in such a poor country? (5 - 15 min)

They were living quite a luxurious life with a nice 9 hole golf course, fishing clubs, with many managers having their own boat. They would even do fishing competitions! There houses were even nicely furnished. Personally, I believe this is unethical. While strong believers in capatilism / trickle down ideology would believe this to be totally fine because they are providing jobs for the locals. However, with such a desparity in wealth and amenities clearly this is not a very equal and ethical distribution of resources and wealth.  

3. Who settled Liberia in the 1800's? How did these settlers interact with the people already living there? How did this play a role in the coup that brought Doe to power? (15-25 min)

Many freed American slaves settled in liberia in the 1800's. They became known as the American Liberians. They replicated the slave society in the US where the American Liberians became the plantation owners while locals became the slaves. This lead to the coup where the Liberians were fed up with the corruption in the government. As such, Doe assassinated the Tolbert.

4. Who led the General Services Agency after the coup, what was this person’s qualifications, and what did this agency do? (15 - 25 min)

Charles Taylor led the General Services Agency. Charles Taylor got a degree in economics from Bently. Taylor got new cars for the cabinet and was arrested for embezzling funds.

5.  In June 1990, workers congregated in front of the Firestone General Manager's house? What were they asking for? What was Firestone's answer, and what was the reason for their answer? (25-35 min)

The workers were asking for refuge away from the battle. Firestone's answer was no, claiming they had no way of protecting them so they could not harbor them. 

6. What did the Firestone management do on June 14, 1990? What were some things that happened with the workers on the farm after this? (25 - 35 min)

\*

7. Where was the attorney for Firestone from? What did he say was the "real dilemma, with a lot of soul searching and tough tough decision making"? (35 - 45 min)

They hired a liberian attorney based in the US. There was tremendous worry for the safety of the thousands of liberians they had employed which was the real dilemma he mentioned.

8. Who was Amos Sawyer? What did Charles Taylor claim his position was? What was the Firestone attorney’s view on their legitimacy of Sawyer's and Taylor's positions?\* What did Sawyer and Taylor say in regard to American intervention? (35 - 45 min)

Amos Sawyer was the interim president. The attorney viewed that Sawyer's and Taylor's positions had no legitimacy. Taylor called himself president and his wife the first lady. 

9. Who were Taylor’s shock troops? (35 - 45 min)

Taylor recruited many children as soldiers. Taylor's special unit was called the small boys unit which were comprised of many young orphans.

10. Who were the Khran and what was happening with them? \* Do you think this should have impacted Firestone’s decision making? (45 - 55 min)

Khran was Doe's tribe and they were attempting to flee the coutry. There were reports that the Khran tribe were at risk of genocide. 

11. What was the key demand made by Taylor to Firestone? (45 - 55 min)

Taylor wanted Firestone to recognize his forces as a defacto government and if Firestone were to come back then they would treat his government as the liberian government. Additionally, he wished Ensmiger (?) would be dismissed.

12. The Firestone lawyer argued that Firestone did the right thing in dealing with Taylor, by saying "“The easy answer for Firestone would have been, in my opinion, to say ‘We’re out of here....'". This could be considered a virtue ethics argument. What are the virtues that he says Firestone is displaying? (55 - 65 min)

\* this was at around 55 but i did not get it

13. Firestone signed a memorandum of understanding with Taylor. What did Firestone receive in this agreement? What did Taylor receive? (55 - 65 min)

Taylor made Firestone pay them taxes. 

14. One of the people interviewed said “they gave us a hard time because we ran away. That’s the term that they used”.  In this statement, who is "they", who is it that "ran away", and what is meant by "gave us a hard time"?



15. In October 1992, Firestone management left Liberia, not to return for several years. What event precipitated this? (65 - 75 min)



16. In his trial, what did Charles Taylor say about the specific role that Firestone played in his rise to power. (75 min - 83 min)



# 2 How does Firestone describe its economic impact, educational and medical impacts, and the benefits to workers in Liberia? Do you think the relationship between Firestone and Liberia is mutually beneficial and ethically commendable, or do you think Firestone is unfairly profiting at the expense of Liberia?

They claim to have a strong economic, educational, and medical impacts for liberain workers. Firestone provides free medical care, has employed over 4000 Liberians and operates 24 schools which in total educate more than 7,000 students. Additionally they have invested more than $2 billion USD in the Liberian economy through payroll, taxes, rubber purchased, and other local goods and services. If we are looking solely at this about page here it can be argued that Firestone and Liberia have a mutually beneficial relationship. However, one can also argue that Firestone is simply profiting off the large amounts of rubber and latex produced in Liberia and reinvesting part of their profits back into Liberia. That being said, it is hard to argue that Firestone is unfairly profiting at the expense of Liberia if the linked article is telling the truth about the strong positive impact Firestone is having on local Liberians.

# 3 When the Liberian civil war came to the Firestone farm, workers sought protection from Firestone management. Firestone said they did not have the capability to provide this protection. What would you have done if you were in the position of the Firestone General Manager?

Personally, if I were a general manager at Firestone I would have provided more support for the employees. Firestone is a strong company and I believe it is in the companies best interest to prioritze the safety of its workers. As such, prioritizing the safety of their employees by ensuring everyone is able to evacuate safely would be a top priority. This could be by helping workers evacuate to adjacent countries or even flying out workers to the US. Workers were already abondoning their homes and going toward the management's manshion so I believe this would still be a valid approach.

# 4 Do you think Firestone made the right decision in working with Charles Taylor? Specifically address in your answer the effects on the Liberians that worked on the Firestone farm, and how this would have affected your decision.

For starters, many of the liberian workers faced exploitation before the war with the poor working conditions at firestone. It is evident that Firestone did not have much regard for their workers rather they simply wanted to resume business as soon as possible due to the fact that the Liberian Farm produced the majority of their latex. As such, if I were in Firestone's position I would seriously find the human cost of continuing operations in Liberia compared to focusing resources elsewhere. The suffering of the workers would have been a key factor in making that decision and prioritizing ethical considerations over financial ones might have led me to withdrawing from Liberia or at least push for stronger protection for workers and humanitarian support.

# 5 Do you think the US should have intervened in the Liberian civil war? What were some of the human rights violations that may have been relevant?

For starters, there was genocide occuring in Liberia because they were killing Khran due to the fact they were from the same tribe as Doe. Additionally, there were plenty of casses of rape, and in general killings of civilians. Additionally, Taylor's children soldiers were a disgusting violation of human rights. On one hand, US intervention could have reducded the extent of these attrocities taking place. On the other hand, did the US have much at stake during the war? Should the US intervene wherever there are violations of human rights? While it may not be specifically the US' responsibility to intervene, I believe it to be the responsibility of the UN (which includes the US) to intervene wherever there are violations of human rights.
