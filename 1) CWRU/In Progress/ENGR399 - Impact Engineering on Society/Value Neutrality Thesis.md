# What is the Value-Neutrality Thesis?
The value neutrality thesis is the idea that the technology / inventors are not at fault for how they are used. For example the idea that guns do not kill people, people kill people. 

This also includes things like nuclear weapons. Ask yourself if nuclear weapons are okay because its the people at fault for using them not the weapons themselves.
