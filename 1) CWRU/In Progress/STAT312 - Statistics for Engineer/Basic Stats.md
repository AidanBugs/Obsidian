# Branches of Statistics
## Descriptive Statistics
Summarize present data. Example is making comparisons of which product is better.
## Inferential Statistics
Drawing conclusions from data that isn't there. Example is predictive data.
# Probability
Probability refers to the study of randomness and uncertainty.
## Probability of an Event
$P(A)=\frac{|A|}{|S|}$
## Mulitplication Rule
$P(x\land y)=P(x)\times P(y)$
# Sample Space
Sample space refers to the set of all possible outcomes. For example $S=\{H,T\}$ refers to the sample space of the possible outcomes of a single coin flip (heads or tails).

See [[Set Theory]] for different ways to manipulate subspaces of sample spaces.
