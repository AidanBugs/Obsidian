# Nodes & Edges
A graph is a set of nodes and a set of edges. Easiest way of thinking about graphs are cities and streets, where the cities are the different nodes and streets are the different edges. 

Some edges can be directed, meaning they can only go one direction (just like streets!). If the edges are directed then the graph is a directed graph. Edges can have different weights as well. Going back to a the city/street example, the weight of an edge could be a toll fee or the distance between 2 cities.
