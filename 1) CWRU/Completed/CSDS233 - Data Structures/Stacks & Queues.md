# Stacks
Stacks are a data structure that follow a first in last out ordering. The main method in java follows a stack data structure where loops and functions generate a new stack within the main stack. Think of a stack of pancakes, the pancake you put on the plate first is the last pancake you will eat.

Stacks in code are similar, the first element you put in the stack cannot be accessed until it is on the top of the stack again, meaning all elements have been popped from the top of the stack. In a stack typically you insert elements into the stack and the last element to be inserted is now at the top of the stack and is the one you access/process.
# Queue
Queues are a data structure that follow a first in first out ordering. Think of a line at a grocery store. The first customer in line is the first that finishes checkout. This means elements inserted first in the queue are the first to be processed.
