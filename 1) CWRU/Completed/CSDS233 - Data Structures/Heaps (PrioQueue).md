# Heaps 
A heap is a way of ordering an array such that the most important element is first. Each element in the heap is given a priority/weight and the element with the highest priority is always at the start of the array. 

Since the heap is known to be sorted inserting into the array is $\log n$ time complexity (binary search). 

This can be similar to a task list in real life. Each task has a certain priority and you do the tasks in order of priority. When adding a new task into the list you reorder accordingly. 

Heaps / Prioqueues are really important for [[Graph Algorithms]] like breadth first search.
