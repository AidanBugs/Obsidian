For some projects I use Google’s Teachable Machine.
Yet it never quite works how I design it to be. 
I thought this fun little project would be a breeze.
Yet there is always a flaw even if it is small.
No matter how hard I try I never seem to fix them all.
My project was a machine that could recognize hand movement.
But sometimes the machine couldn’t read my intent.
I took photos of me in my room, and I watched the project bloom.
I decided to show it to my dad, yet it didn’t work so I got a little sad.
So I searched and searched and learned about algorithmic bias,
My machine wouldn’t work because the data hardly allowed it.
The data I used was only me in my room.
So then I knew the training must resume. 
I needed different people and places with a bunch of different faces.
When I tested again and showed it to a friend,
I found that it worked nice and well in the end.
So now I learned about diverse training data
