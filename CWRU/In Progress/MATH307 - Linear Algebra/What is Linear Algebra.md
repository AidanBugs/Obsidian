### Basics
- y = mx + b
	- y & x are variables (they can change)
	- m & b are constants
	- Points (x,y) satisfy this equation
	- Does not work for ANY line (vertical lines)
- ax + by = c
	- Same as above, works for any line 
	- This is a Linear Equation in 2 variables
- ax + by + cz = d
	- Linear Equation in 3 variables
	- This is a Plane in 3d space 
- a1x1 + a2x2 + … anxn = b
	- Linear Equation in n variables
- m by n Linear System
	- m represents # of equations
	- n represents # of variables
	- EX:
		- a11x1 + a12x2 + … a1nxn = b1
		- a21x1 + a22x2 + … a2nxn = b2 
		- am1x1 + am2x2 + … amnxn = bm
	- A solution of a Linear System is a choice for ALL of values for the variables that makes all the equations in the system true
		- A solution can be found by any means necessary, if it works it works. :thumb up:
		- Guess and check is a valid way of finding solution
    

### Rat Poison Principle
- How do you tell if something is rat poison? Feed it to a rat.
    

- If it kills the rat its rat poison. In math things are defined by what they do.
    

- Examples
    

- Def. A Linear System is homogeneous if bi = 0 ∀i
    
- Thm. Every homogeneous Linear System has x1 = … = xn = 0 as a solution
    
- Pf If x1 = … = xn = 0 then
    

- a11x1 + a12x2 + … a1nxn = 0
    
- a21x1 + a22x2 + … a2nxn = 0
    
- am1x1 + am2x2 + … amnxn = 0 (show box here for end of proof)
    

- Linear Algebra is concerned with linear systems and their solutions. Do solutions exist and is there uniqueness (only one solution)
    
- am1x1 + am2x2 + … amnxn = ym -> Recipe for turning (x1, … , xn) into  (y1, … , yn)
