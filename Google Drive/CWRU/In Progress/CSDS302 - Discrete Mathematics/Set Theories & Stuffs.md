Sets are just groupings of elements. Not determined by order or repeat values. Sets can contain other sets
- EX:
	- A1 = {1,2,3}
	- A2 = {2,2,2,1,3}
	- Then A1= A2
		- A1 and A2 have the same unique elements so they represent the same set
Magnitude is how many unique elements there are. This notation is Cardinality! 
- |A2| = 3 because 3 unique elements
- Z
	- Set of all integers
	- |Z| = infinity
- Q
	- Set of rational numbers (fractions)
	- |Q| = infinity
- R
	- Set of real numbers (non imaginary)
	- |R| = Infinity
- |Z| = |Q| < |R|

Property Base Form
- A = { Set | Condition(s) }  
- Ex:
	- A2 = { x 𝜖 Z | 1 < x < 3 }
	- A2. { 2 }

---

- A x B = { (a,b) | a 𝜖 A, b 𝜖 B }
    
- | A x B | = m n |A| = m |B| = n 
    

Subsets

- A is a Subset of B (A<B) if every x 𝜖 A, x 𝜖 B
    
- Def a Power set of A
    

- P(A) = the set of all Subsets of A
    
- EX.
    

- A2 = {2,1}
    
- P(A2) = { {2}, {1}, {1,2}, phi (empty) } 
    

- |A| = n
    
- |P(A)| = 2n 
    

- P(A) is made of n-bits, either set contains or does not contain each element in the set
    

1.3 - Relations & Functions

- Def A and B are sets A relation R from A to B is a subset of AxB
    
- Ex
    

- A = {1,2}         B = {1,2,3}
    
- Define a relation R from A to B as(x,y) 𝜖 R of (x-y) / z 𝜖 R
    

- R = { (1,1), (2,2), (1,3) }
    

- Functions
    

- Function F from A to B is a special relation
    
- 1) For every element x 𝜖 A there is always y 𝜖 B such that (x,y) 𝜖 R
    
- 2) For every element x 𝜖 A, y 𝜖 B, z 𝜖 B. If (x,y) 𝜖 F and (x,z) 𝜖 F then y = z
    

- Domain
    

- Set of all possible inputs in the function / relation
    

- Co-domain
    

- Set of all possible outputs in the function / relation
    

- Range
    

- Set of all outputs in the function / relation
    

- Ex. A function’s co-domain could include 0 but if 0 is never an output to a specific function / relation, which would mean the range does not include 0 but the co-domain would include 0.
    

- Image 
    

- The image is the output for a specific input
    

- For a function, the image is a value, but for relations the image could be a set of values
    

- Pre-image
    

- The pre-image is a set of inputs that correspond to one output
    

7.1 & 7.2

Ex: X x Y

- 1 to 1 functions
    

- Must follow all function rules
    
- Each input has only 1 unique output, meaning each output is different than other outputs
    
- |X| <= |Y|
    

- Onto functions
    

- Every y Y has a pre-image
    
- Range of F = |Y|
    
- |X| >= |Y|
    

- Bijective function, both 1 to 1 and onto 
    

- |X| = |Y|
